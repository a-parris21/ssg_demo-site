        <h1>The Naval Treaty</h1>
        <p>The July which immediately succeeded my marriage was made<br>memorable by three cases of interest, in which I had the<br>privilege of being associated with Sherlock Holmes and of<br>studying his methods. I find them recorded in my notes under the<br>headings of “The Adventure of the Second Stain,” “The Adventure<br>of the Naval Treaty,” and “The Adventure of the Tired Captain.”<br>The first of these, however, deals with interest of such<br>importance and implicates so many of the first families in the<br>kingdom that for many years it will be impossible to make it<br>public. No case, however, in which Holmes was engaged has ever<br>illustrated the value of his analytical methods so clearly or has<br>impressed those who were associated with him so deeply. I still<br>retain an almost verbatim report of the interview in which he<br>demonstrated the true facts of the case to Monsieur Dubuque of<br>the Paris police, and Fritz von Waldbaum, the well-known<br>specialist of Dantzig, both of whom had wasted their energies<br>upon what proved to be side-issues. The new century will have<br>come, however, before the story can be safely told. Meanwhile I<br>pass on to the second on my list, which promised also at one time<br>to be of national importance, and was marked by several incidents<br>which give it a quite unique character.<br></p>
<p>During my school-days I had been intimately associated with a lad<br>named Percy Phelps, who was of much the same age as myself,<br>though he was two classes ahead of me. He was a very brilliant<br>boy, and carried away every prize which the school had to offer,<br>finished his exploits by winning a scholarship which sent him on<br>to continue his triumphant career at Cambridge. He was, I<br>remember, extremely well connected, and even when we were all<br>little boys together we knew that his mother’s brother was Lord<br>Holdhurst, the great conservative politician. This gaudy<br>relationship did him little good at school. On the contrary, it<br>seemed rather a piquant thing to us to chevy him about the<br>playground and hit him over the shins with a wicket. But it was<br>another thing when he came out into the world. I heard vaguely<br>that his abilities and the influences which he commanded had won<br>him a good position at the Foreign Office, and then he passed<br>completely out of my mind until the following letter recalled his<br>existence:<br></p>
<p>Briarbrae, Woking.<br>    My dear Watson,—I have no doubt that you can remember<br>    “Tadpole” Phelps, who was in the fifth form when you were in<br>    the third. It is possible even that you may have heard that<br>    through my uncle’s influence I obtained a good appointment at<br>    the Foreign Office, and that I was in a situation of trust<br>    and honour until a horrible misfortune came suddenly to blast<br>    my career.<br>    There is no use writing of the details of that dreadful<br>    event. In the event of your acceding to my request it is<br>    probable that I shall have to narrate them to you. I have<br>    only just recovered from nine weeks of brain-fever, and am<br>    still exceedingly weak. Do you think that you could bring<br>    your friend Mr. Holmes down to see me? I should like to have<br>    his opinion of the case, though the authorities assure me<br>    that nothing more can be done. Do try to bring him down, and<br>    as soon as possible. Every minute seems an hour while I live<br>    in this state of horrible suspense. Assure him that if I have<br>    not asked his advice sooner it was not because I did not<br>    appreciate his talents, but because I have been off my head<br>    ever since the blow fell. Now I am clear again, though I dare<br>    not think of it too much for fear of a relapse. I am still so<br>    weak that I have to write, as you see, by dictating. Do try<br>    to bring him.<br></p>
<p>Your old schoolfellow,<br>Percy Phelps.<br></p>
<p>There was something that touched me as I read this letter,<br>something pitiable in the reiterated appeals to bring Holmes. So<br>moved was I that even had it been a difficult matter I should<br>have tried it, but of course I knew well that Holmes loved his<br>art, so that he was ever as ready to bring his aid as his client<br>could be to receive it. My wife agreed with me that not a moment<br>should be lost in laying the matter before him, and so within an<br>hour of breakfast-time I found myself back once more in the old<br>rooms in Baker Street.<br></p>
<p>Holmes was seated at his side-table clad in his dressing-gown,<br>and working hard over a chemical investigation. A large curved<br>retort was boiling furiously in the bluish flame of a Bunsen<br>burner, and the distilled drops were condensing into a two-litre<br>measure. My friend hardly glanced up as I entered, and I, seeing<br>that his investigation must be of importance, seated myself in an<br>armchair and waited. He dipped into this bottle or that, drawing<br>out a few drops of each with his glass pipette, and finally<br>brought a test-tube containing a solution over to the table. In<br>his right hand he held a slip of litmus-paper.<br></p>
<p>“You come at a crisis, Watson,” said he. “If this paper remains<br>blue, all is well. If it turns red, it means a man’s life.” He<br>dipped it into the test-tube and it flushed at once into a dull,<br>dirty crimson. “Hum! I thought as much!” he cried. “I will be at<br>your service in an instant, Watson. You will find tobacco in the<br>Persian slipper.” He turned to his desk and scribbled off several<br>telegrams, which were handed over to the page-boy. Then he threw<br>himself down into the chair opposite, and drew up his knees until<br>his fingers clasped round his long, thin shins.<br></p>
<p>“A very commonplace little murder,” said he. “You’ve got<br>something better, I fancy. You are the stormy petrel of crime,<br>Watson. What is it?”<br></p>
<p>I handed him the letter, which he read with the most concentrated<br>attention.<br></p>
<p>“It does not tell us very much, does it?” he remarked, as he<br>handed it back to me.<br></p>
<p>“Hardly anything.”<br></p>
<p>“And yet the writing is of interest.”<br></p>
<p>“But the writing is not his own.”<br></p>
<p>“Precisely. It is a woman’s.”<br></p>
<p>“A man’s surely,” I cried.<br></p>
<p>“No, a woman’s, and a woman of rare character. You see, at the<br>commencement of an investigation it is something to know that<br>your client is in close contact with some one who, for good or<br>evil, has an exceptional nature. My interest is already awakened<br>in the case. If you are ready we will start at once for Woking,<br>and see this diplomatist who is in such evil case, and the lady<br>to whom he dictates his letters.”<br></p>
<p>We were fortunate enough to catch an early train at Waterloo, and<br>in a little under an hour we found ourselves among the fir-woods<br>and the heather of Woking. Briarbrae proved to be a large<br>detached house standing in extensive grounds within a few<br>minutes’ walk of the station. On sending in our cards we were<br>shown into an elegantly appointed drawing-room, where we were<br>joined in a few minutes by a rather stout man who received us<br>with much hospitality. His age may have been nearer forty than<br>thirty, but his cheeks were so ruddy and his eyes so merry that<br>he still conveyed the impression of a plump and mischievous boy.<br></p>
<p>“I am so glad that you have come,” said he, shaking our hands<br>with effusion. “Percy has been inquiring for you all morning. Ah,<br>poor old chap, he clings to any straw! His father and his mother<br>asked me to see you, for the mere mention of the subject is very<br>painful to them.”<br></p>
<p>“We have had no details yet,” observed Holmes. “I perceive that<br>you are not yourself a member of the family.”<br></p>
<p>Our acquaintance looked surprised, and then, glancing down, he<br>began to laugh.<br></p>
<p>“Of course you saw the ‘J.H.’ monogram on my locket,” said he.<br>“For a moment I thought you had done something clever. Joseph<br>Harrison is my name, and as Percy is to marry my sister Annie I<br>shall at least be a relation by marriage. You will find my sister<br>in his room, for she has nursed him hand-and-foot this two months<br>back. Perhaps we’d better go in at once, for I know how impatient<br>he is.”<br></p>
<p>The chamber in which we were shown was on the same floor as the<br>drawing-room. It was furnished partly as a sitting and partly as<br>a bedroom, with flowers arranged daintily in every nook and<br>corner. A young man, very pale and worn, was lying upon a sofa<br>near the open window, through which came the rich scent of the<br>garden and the balmy summer air. A woman was sitting beside him,<br>who rose as we entered.<br></p>
<p>“Shall I leave, Percy?” she asked.<br></p>
<p>He clutched her hand to detain her. “How are you, Watson?” said<br>he, cordially. “I should never have known you under that<br>moustache, and I daresay you would not be prepared to swear to<br>me. This I presume is your celebrated friend, Mr. Sherlock<br>Holmes?”<br></p>
<p>I introduced him in a few words, and we both sat down. The stout<br>young man had left us, but his sister still remained with her<br>hand in that of the invalid. She was a striking-looking woman, a<br>little short and thick for symmetry, but with a beautiful olive<br>complexion, large, dark, Italian eyes, and a wealth of deep black<br>hair. Her rich tints made the white face of her companion the<br>more worn and haggard by the contrast.<br></p>
<p>“I won’t waste your time,” said he, raising himself upon the<br>sofa. “I’ll plunge into the matter without further preamble. I<br>was a happy and successful man, Mr. Holmes, and on the eve of<br>being married, when a sudden and dreadful misfortune wrecked all<br>my prospects in life.<br></p>
<p>“I was, as Watson may have told you, in the Foreign Office, and<br>through the influences of my uncle, Lord Holdhurst, I rose<br>rapidly to a responsible position. When my uncle became foreign<br>minister in this administration he gave me several missions of<br>trust, and as I always brought them to a successful conclusion,<br>he came at last to have the utmost confidence in my ability and<br>tact.<br></p>
<p>“Nearly ten weeks ago—to be more accurate, on the 23rd of May—he<br>called me into his private room, and, after complimenting me on<br>the good work which I had done, he informed me that he had a new<br>commission of trust for me to execute.<br></p>
<p>“‘This,’ said he, taking a grey roll of paper from his bureau,<br>‘is the original of that secret treaty between England and Italy<br>of which, I regret to say, some rumours have already got into the<br>public press. It is of enormous importance that nothing further<br>should leak out. The French or the Russian embassy would pay an<br>immense sum to learn the contents of these papers. They should<br>not leave my bureau were it not that it is absolutely necessary<br>to have them copied. You have a desk in your office?’<br></p>
<p>“‘Yes, sir.’<br></p>
<p>“‘Then take the treaty and lock it up there. I shall give<br>directions that you may remain behind when the others go, so that<br>you may copy it at your leisure without fear of being overlooked.<br>When you have finished, relock both the original and the draft in<br>the desk, and hand them over to me personally to-morrow morning.’<br></p>
<p>“I took the papers and—”<br></p>
<p>“Excuse me an instant,” said Holmes. “Were you alone during this<br>conversation?”<br></p>
<p>“Absolutely.”<br></p>
<p>“In a large room?”<br></p>
<p>“Thirty feet each way.”<br></p>
<p>“In the centre?”<br></p>
<p>“Yes, about it.”<br></p>
<p>“And speaking low?”<br></p>
<p>“My uncle’s voice is always remarkably low. I hardly spoke at<br>all.”<br></p>
<p>“Thank you,” said Holmes, shutting his eyes; “pray go on.”<br></p>
<p>“I did exactly what he indicated, and waited until the other<br>clerks had departed. One of them in my room, Charles Gorot, had<br>some arrears of work to make up, so I left him there and went out<br>to dine. When I returned he was gone. I was anxious to hurry my<br>work, for I knew that Joseph—the Mr. Harrison whom you saw just<br>now—was in town, and that he would travel down to Woking by the<br>eleven o’clock train, and I wanted if possible to catch it.<br></p>
<p>“When I came to examine the treaty I saw at once that it was of<br>such importance that my uncle had been guilty of no exaggeration<br>in what he had said. Without going into details, I may say that<br>it defined the position of Great Britain towards the Triple<br>Alliance, and fore-shadowed the policy which this country would<br>pursue in the event of the French fleet gaining a complete<br>ascendancy over that of Italy in the Mediterranean. The questions<br>treated in it were purely naval. At the end were the signatures<br>of the high dignitaries who had signed it. I glanced my eyes over<br>it, and then settled down to my task of copying.<br></p>
<p>“It was a long document, written in the French language, and<br>containing twenty-six separate articles. I copied as quickly as I<br>could, but at nine o’clock I had only done nine articles, and it<br>seemed hopeless for me to attempt to catch my train. I was<br>feeling drowsy and stupid, partly from my dinner and also from<br>the effects of a long day’s work. A cup of coffee would clear my<br>brain. A commissionnaire remains all night in a little lodge at<br>the foot of the stairs, and is in the habit of making coffee at<br>his spirit-lamp for any of the officials who may be working over<br>time. I rang the bell, therefore, to summon him.<br></p>
<p>“To my surprise, it was a woman who answered the summons, a<br>large, coarse-faced, elderly woman, in an apron. She explained<br>that she was the commissionnaire’s wife, who did the charing, and<br>I gave her the order for the coffee.<br></p>
<p>“I wrote two more articles and then, feeling more drowsy than<br>ever, I rose and walked up and down the room to stretch my legs.<br>My coffee had not yet come, and I wondered what the cause of the<br>delay could be. Opening the door, I started down the corridor to<br>find out. There was a straight passage, dimly lighted, which led<br>from the room in which I had been working, and was the only exit<br>from it. It ended in a curving staircase, with the<br>commissionnaire’s lodge in the passage at the bottom. Half-way<br>down this staircase is a small landing, with another passage<br>running into it at right angles. This second one leads by means<br>of a second small stair to a side door, used by servants, and<br>also as a short cut by clerks when coming from Charles Street.<br>Here is a rough chart of the place.”<br></p>
<p>rough chart<br></p>
<p>“Thank you. I think that I quite follow you,” said Sherlock<br>Holmes.<br></p>
<p>“It is of the utmost importance that you should notice this<br>point. I went down the stairs and into the hall, where I found<br>the commissionnaire fast asleep in his box, with the kettle<br>boiling furiously upon the spirit-lamp. I took off the kettle and<br>blew out the lamp, for the water was spurting over the floor.<br>Then I put out my hand and was about to shake the man, who was<br>still sleeping soundly, when a bell over his head rang loudly,<br>and he woke with a start.<br></p>
<p>“‘Mr. Phelps, sir!’ said he, looking at me in bewilderment.<br></p>
<p>“‘I came down to see if my coffee was ready.’<br></p>
<p>“‘I was boiling the kettle when I fell asleep, sir.’ He looked at<br>me and then up at the still quivering bell with an ever-growing<br>astonishment upon his face.<br></p>
<p>“‘If you was here, sir, then who rang the bell?’ he asked.<br></p>
<p>“‘The bell!’ I cried. ‘What bell is it?’<br></p>
<p>“‘It’s the bell of the room you were working in.’<br></p>
<p>“A cold hand seemed to close round my heart. Some one, then, was<br>in that room where my precious treaty lay upon the table. I ran<br>frantically up the stairs and along the passage. There was no one<br>in the corridors, Mr. Holmes. There was no one in the room. All<br>was exactly as I left it, save only that the papers which had<br>been committed to my care had been taken from the desk on which<br>they lay. The copy was there, and the original was gone.”<br></p>
<p>Holmes sat up in his chair and rubbed his hands. I could see that<br>the problem was entirely to his heart. “Pray, what did you do<br>then?” he murmured.<br></p>
<p>“I recognised in an instant that the thief must have come up the<br>stairs from the side door. Of course I must have met him if he<br>had come the other way.”<br></p>
<p>“You were satisfied that he could not have been concealed in the<br>room all the time, or in the corridor which you have just<br>described as dimly lighted?”<br></p>
<p>“It is absolutely impossible. A rat could not conceal himself<br>either in the room or the corridor. There is no cover at all.”<br></p>
<p>“Thank you. Pray proceed.”<br></p>
<p>“The commissionnaire, seeing by my pale face that something was<br>to be feared, had followed me upstairs. Now we both rushed along<br>the corridor and down the steep steps which led to Charles<br>Street. The door at the bottom was closed, but unlocked. We flung<br>it open and rushed out. I can distinctly remember that as we did<br>so there came three chimes from a neighbouring clock. It was<br>quarter to ten.”<br></p>
<p>“That is of enormous importance,” said Holmes, making a note upon<br>his shirt-cuff.<br></p>
<p>“The night was very dark, and a thin, warm rain was falling.<br>There was no one in Charles Street, but a great traffic was going<br>on, as usual, in Whitehall, at the extremity. We rushed along the<br>pavement, bare-headed as we were, and at the far corner we found<br>a policeman standing.<br></p>
<p>“‘A robbery has been committed,’ I gasped. ‘A document of immense<br>value has been stolen from the Foreign Office. Has any one passed<br>this way?’<br></p>
<p>“‘I have been standing here for a quarter of an hour, sir,’ said<br>he; ‘only one person has passed during that time—a woman, tall<br>and elderly, with a Paisley shawl.’<br></p>
<p>“‘Ah, that is only my wife,’ cried the commissionnaire; ‘has no<br>one else passed?’<br></p>
<p>“‘No one.’<br></p>
<p>“‘Then it must be the other way that the thief took,’ cried the<br>fellow, tugging at my sleeve.<br></p>
<p>“‘But I was not satisfied, and the attempts which he made to draw<br>me away increased my suspicions.<br></p>
<p>“‘Which way did the woman go?’ I cried.<br></p>
<p>“‘I don’t know, sir. I noticed her pass, but I had no special<br>reason for watching her. She seemed to be in a hurry.’<br></p>
<p>“‘How long ago was it?’<br></p>
<p>“‘Oh, not very many minutes.’<br></p>
<p>“‘Within the last five?’<br></p>
<p>“‘Well, it could not be more than five.’<br></p>
<p>“‘You’re only wasting your time, sir, and every minute now is of<br>importance,’ cried the commissionnaire; ‘take my word for it that<br>my old woman has nothing to do with it, and come down to the<br>other end of the street. Well, if you won’t, I will.’ And with<br>that he rushed off in the other direction.<br></p>
<p>“But I was after him in an instant and caught him by the sleeve.<br></p>
<p>“‘Where do you live?’ said I.<br></p>
<p>“‘16 Ivy Lane, Brixton,’ he answered. ‘But don’t let yourself be<br>drawn away upon a false scent, Mr. Phelps. Come to the other end<br>of the street and let us see if we can hear of anything.’<br></p>
<p>“Nothing was to be lost by following his advice. With the<br>policeman we both hurried down, but only to find the street full<br>of traffic, many people coming and going, but all only too eager<br>to get to a place of safety upon so wet a night. There was no<br>lounger who could tell us who had passed.<br></p>
<p>“Then we returned to the office, and searched the stairs and the<br>passage without result. The corridor which led to the room was<br>laid down with a kind of creamy linoleum which shows an<br>impression very easily. We examined it very carefully, but found<br>no outline of any footmark.”<br></p>
<p>“Had it been raining all evening?”<br></p>
<p>“Since about seven.”<br></p>
<p>“How is it, then, that the woman who came into the room about<br>nine left no traces with her muddy boots?”<br></p>
<p>“I am glad you raised the point. It occurred to me at the time.<br>The charwomen are in the habit of taking off their boots at the<br>commissionnaire’s office, and putting on list slippers.”<br></p>
<p>“That is very clear. There were no marks, then, though the night<br>was a wet one? The chain of events is certainly one of<br>extraordinary interest. What did you do next?<br></p>
<p>“We examined the room also. There is no possibility of a secret<br>door, and the windows are quite thirty feet from the ground. Both<br>of them were fastened on the inside. The carpet prevents any<br>possibility of a trap-door, and the ceiling is of the ordinary<br>whitewashed kind. I will pledge my life that whoever stole my<br>papers could only have come through the door.”<br></p>
<p>“How about the fireplace?”<br></p>
<p>“They use none. There is a stove. The bell-rope hangs from the<br>wire just to the right of my desk. Whoever rang it must have come<br>right up to the desk to do it. But why should any criminal wish<br>to ring the bell? It is a most insoluble mystery.”<br></p>
<p>“Certainly the incident was unusual. What were your next steps?<br>You examined the room, I presume, to see if the intruder had left<br>any traces—any cigar-end or dropped glove or hairpin or other<br>trifle?”<br></p>
<p>“There was nothing of the sort.”<br></p>
<p>“No smell?”<br></p>
<p>“Well, we never thought of that.”<br></p>
<p>“Ah, a scent of tobacco would have been worth a great deal to us<br>in such an investigation.”<br></p>
<p>“I never smoke myself, so I think I should have observed it if<br>there had been any smell of tobacco. There was absolutely no clue<br>of any kind. The only tangible fact was that the<br>commissionnaire’s wife—Mrs. Tangey was the name—had hurried out<br>of the place. He could give no explanation save that it was about<br>the time when the woman always went home. The policeman and I<br>agreed that our best plan would be to seize the woman before she<br>could get rid of the papers, presuming that she had them.<br></p>
<p>“The alarm had reached Scotland Yard by this time, and Mr.<br>Forbes, the detective, came round at once and took up the case<br>with a great deal of energy. We hired a hansom, and in half an<br>hour we were at the address which had been given to us. A young<br>woman opened the door, who proved to be Mrs. Tangey’s eldest<br>daughter. Her mother had not come back yet, and we were shown<br>into the front room to wait.<br></p>
<p>“About ten minutes later a knock came at the door, and here we<br>made the one serious mistake for which I blame myself. Instead of<br>opening the door ourselves, we allowed the girl to do so. We<br>heard her say, ‘Mother, there are two men in the house waiting to<br>see you,’ and an instant afterwards we heard the patter of feet<br>rushing down the passage. Forbes flung open the door, and we both<br>ran into the back room or kitchen, but the woman had got there<br>before us. She stared at us with defiant eyes, and then, suddenly<br>recognising me, an expression of absolute astonishment came over<br>her face.<br></p>
<p>“‘Why, if it isn’t Mr. Phelps, of the office!’ she cried.<br></p>
<p>“‘Come, come, who did you think we were when you ran away from<br>us?’ asked my companion.<br></p>
<p>“‘I thought you were the brokers,’ said she, ‘we have had some<br>trouble with a tradesman.’<br></p>
<p>“‘That’s not quite good enough,’ answered Forbes. ‘We have reason<br>to believe that you have taken a paper of importance from the<br>Foreign Office, and that you ran in here to dispose of it. You<br>must come back with us to Scotland Yard to be searched.’<br></p>
<p>“It was in vain that she protested and resisted. A four-wheeler<br>was brought, and we all three drove back in it. We had first made<br>an examination of the kitchen, and especially of the kitchen<br>fire, to see whether she might have made away with the papers<br>during the instant that she was alone. There were no signs,<br>however, of any ashes or scraps. When we reached Scotland Yard<br>she was handed over at once to the female searcher. I waited in<br>an agony of suspense until she came back with her report. There<br>were no signs of the papers.<br></p>
<p>“Then for the first time the horror of my situation came in its<br>full force. Hitherto I had been acting, and action had numbed<br>thought. I had been so confident of regaining the treaty at once<br>that I had not dared to think of what would be the consequence if<br>I failed to do so. But now there was nothing more to be done, and<br>I had leisure to realize my position. It was horrible. Watson<br>there would tell you that I was a nervous, sensitive boy at<br>school. It is my nature. I thought of my uncle and of his<br>colleagues in the Cabinet, of the shame which I had brought upon<br>him, upon myself, upon every one connected with me. What though I<br>was the victim of an extraordinary accident? No allowance is made<br>for accidents where diplomatic interests are at stake. I was<br>ruined, shamefully, hopelessly ruined. I don’t know what I did. I<br>fancy I must have made a scene. I have a dim recollection of a<br>group of officials who crowded round me, endeavouring to soothe<br>me. One of them drove down with me to Waterloo, and saw me into<br>the Woking train. I believe that he would have come all the way<br>had it not been that Dr. Ferrier, who lives near me, was going<br>down by that very train. The doctor most kindly took charge of<br>me, and it was well he did so, for I had a fit in the station,<br>and before we reached home I was practically a raving maniac.<br></p>
<p>“You can imagine the state of things here when they were roused<br>from their beds by the doctor’s ringing and found me in this<br>condition. Poor Annie here and my mother were broken-hearted. Dr.<br>Ferrier had just heard enough from the detective at the station<br>to be able to give an idea of what had happened, and his story<br>did not mend matters. It was evident to all that I was in for a<br>long illness, so Joseph was bundled out of this cheery bedroom,<br>and it was turned into a sick-room for me. Here I have lain, Mr.<br>Holmes, for over nine weeks, unconscious, and raving with<br>brain-fever. If it had not been for Miss Harrison here and for<br>the doctor’s care I should not be speaking to you now. She has<br>nursed me by day and a hired nurse has looked after me by night,<br>for in my mad fits I was capable of anything. Slowly my reason<br>has cleared, but it is only during the last three days that my<br>memory has quite returned. Sometimes I wish that it never had.<br>The first thing that I did was to wire to Mr. Forbes, who had the<br>case in hand. He came out, and assures me that, though everything<br>has been done, no trace of a clue has been discovered. The<br>commissionnaire and his wife have been examined in every way<br>without any light being thrown upon the matter. The suspicions of<br>the police then rested upon young Gorot, who, as you may<br>remember, stayed over time in the office that night. His<br>remaining behind and his French name were really the only two<br>points which could suggest suspicion; but, as a matter of fact, I<br>did not begin work until he had gone, and his people are of<br>Huguenot extraction, but as English in sympathy and tradition as<br>you and I are. Nothing was found to implicate him in any way, and<br>there the matter dropped. I turn to you, Mr. Holmes, as<br>absolutely my last hope. If you fail me, then my honour as well<br>as my position are forever forfeited.”<br></p>
<p>The invalid sank back upon his cushions, tired out by this long<br>recital, while his nurse poured him out a glass of some<br>stimulating medicine. Holmes sat silently, with his head thrown<br>back and his eyes closed, in an attitude which might seem<br>listless to a stranger, but which I knew betokened the most<br>intense self-absorption.<br></p>
<p>“You statement has been so explicit,” said he at last, “that you<br>have really left me very few questions to ask. There is one of<br>the very utmost importance, however. Did you tell any one that<br>you had this special task to perform?”<br></p>
<p>“No one.”<br></p>
<p>“Not Miss Harrison here, for example?”<br></p>
<p>“No. I had not been back to Woking between getting the order and<br>executing the commission.”<br></p>
<p>“And none of your people had by chance been to see you?”<br></p>
<p>“None.”<br></p>
<p>“Did any of them know their way about in the office?”<br></p>
<p>“Oh, yes, all of them had been shown over it.”<br></p>
<p>“Still, of course, if you said nothing to any one about the<br>treaty these inquiries are irrelevant.”<br></p>
<p>“I said nothing.”<br></p>
<p>“Do you know anything of the commissionnaire?”<br></p>
<p>“Nothing except that he is an old soldier.”<br></p>
<p>“What regiment?”<br></p>
<p>“Oh, I have heard—Coldstream Guards.”<br></p>
<p>“Thank you. I have no doubt I can get details from Forbes. The<br>authorities are excellent at amassing facts, though they do not<br>always use them to advantage. What a lovely thing a rose is!”<br></p>
<p>He walked past the couch to the open window, and held up the<br>drooping stalk of a moss-rose, looking down at the dainty blend<br>of crimson and green. It was a new phase of his character to me,<br>for I had never before seen him show any keen interest in natural<br>objects.<br></p>
<p>“There is nothing in which deduction is so necessary as in<br>religion,” said he, leaning with his back against the shutters.<br>“It can be built up as an exact science by the reasoner. Our<br>highest assurance of the goodness of Providence seems to me to<br>rest in the flowers. All other things, our powers our desires,<br>our food, are all really necessary for our existence in the first<br>instance. But this rose is an extra. Its smell and its colour are<br>an embellishment of life, not a condition of it. It is only<br>goodness which gives extras, and so I say again that we have much<br>to hope from the flowers.”<br></p>
<p>Percy Phelps and his nurse looked at Holmes during this<br>demonstration with surprise and a good deal of disappointment<br>written upon their faces. He had fallen into a reverie, with the<br>moss-rose between his fingers. It had lasted some minutes before<br>the young lady broke in upon it.<br></p>
<p>“Do you see any prospect of solving this mystery, Mr. Holmes?”<br>she asked, with a touch of asperity in her voice.<br></p>
<p>“Oh, the mystery!” he answered, coming back with a start to the<br>realities of life. “Well, it would be absurd to deny that the<br>case is a very abstruse and complicated one, but I can promise<br>you that I will look into the matter and let you know any points<br>which may strike me.”<br></p>
<p>“Do you see any clue?”<br></p>
<p>“You have furnished me with seven, but, of course, I must test<br>them before I can pronounce upon their value.”<br></p>
<p>“You suspect some one?”<br></p>
<p>“I suspect myself.”<br></p>
<p>“What!”<br></p>
<p>“Of coming to conclusions too rapidly.”<br></p>
<p>“Then go to London and test your conclusions.”<br></p>
<p>“Your advice is very excellent, Miss Harrison,” said Holmes,<br>rising. “I think, Watson, we cannot do better. Do not allow<br>yourself to indulge in false hopes, Mr. Phelps. The affair is a<br>very tangled one.”<br></p>
<p>“I shall be in a fever until I see you again,” cried the<br>diplomatist.<br></p>
<p>“Well, I’ll come out by the same train to-morrow, though it’s<br>more than likely that my report will be a negative one.”<br></p>
<p>“God bless you for promising to come,” cried our client. “It<br>gives me fresh life to know that something is being done. By the<br>way, I have had a letter from Lord Holdhurst.”<br></p>
<p>“Ha! What did he say?”<br></p>
<p>“He was cold, but not harsh. I daresay my severe illness<br>prevented him from being that. He repeated that the matter was of<br>the utmost importance, and added that no steps would be taken<br>about my future—by which he means, of course, my dismissal—until<br>my health was restored and I had an opportunity of repairing my<br>misfortune.”<br></p>
<p>“Well, that was reasonable and considerate,” said Holmes. “Come,<br>Watson, for we have a good day’s work before us in town.”<br></p>
<p>Mr. Joseph Harrison drove us down to the station, and we were<br>soon whirling up in a Portsmouth train. Holmes was sunk in<br>profound thought, and hardly opened his mouth until we had passed<br>Clapham Junction.<br></p>
<p>“It’s a very cheery thing to come into London by any of these<br>lines which run high, and allow you to look down upon the houses<br>like this.”<br></p>
<p>I thought he was joking, for the view was sordid enough, but he<br>soon explained himself.<br></p>
<p>“Look at those big, isolated clumps of building rising up above<br>the slates, like brick islands in a lead-coloured sea.”<br></p>
<p>“The board-schools.”<br></p>
<p>“Light-houses, my boy! Beacons of the future! Capsules with<br>hundreds of bright little seeds in each, out of which will spring<br>the wise, better England of the future. I suppose that man Phelps<br>does not drink?”<br></p>
<p>“I should not think so.”<br></p>
<p>“Nor should I, but we are bound to take every possibility into<br>account. The poor devil has certainly got himself into very deep<br>water, and it’s a question whether we shall ever be able to get<br>him ashore. What did you think of Miss Harrison?”<br></p>
<p>“A girl of strong character.”<br></p>
<p>“Yes, but she is a good sort, or I am mistaken. She and her<br>brother are the only children of an iron-master somewhere up<br>Northumberland way. He got engaged to her when traveling last<br>winter, and she came down to be introduced to his people, with<br>her brother as escort. Then came the smash, and she stayed on to<br>nurse her lover, while brother Joseph, finding himself pretty<br>snug, stayed on too. I’ve been making a few independent<br>inquiries, you see. But to-day must be a day of inquiries.”<br></p>
<p>“My practice—” I began.<br></p>
<p>“Oh, if you find your own cases more interesting than mine—” said<br>Holmes, with some asperity.<br></p>
<p>“I was going to say that my practice could get along very well<br>for a day or two, since it is the slackest time in the year.”<br></p>
<p>“Excellent,” said he, recovering his good-humour. “Then we’ll<br>look into this matter together. I think that we should begin by<br>seeing Forbes. He can probably tell us all the details we want<br>until we know from what side the case is to be approached.”<br></p>
<p>“You said you had a clue?”<br></p>
<p>“Well, we have several, but we can only test their value by<br>further inquiry. The most difficult crime to track is the one<br>which is purposeless. Now this is not purposeless. Who is it who<br>profits by it? There is the French ambassador, there is the<br>Russian, there is whoever might sell it to either of these, and<br>there is Lord Holdhurst.”<br></p>
<p>“Lord Holdhurst!”<br></p>
<p>“Well, it is just conceivable that a statesman might find himself<br>in a position where he was not sorry to have such a document<br>accidentally destroyed.”<br></p>
<p>“Not a statesman with the honourable record of Lord Holdhurst?”<br></p>
<p>“It is a possibility and we cannot afford to disregard it. We<br>shall see the noble lord to-day and find out if he can tell us<br>anything. Meanwhile I have already set inquiries on foot.”<br></p>
<p>“Already?”<br></p>
<p>“Yes, I sent wires from Woking station to every evening paper in<br>London. This advertisement will appear in each of them.”<br></p>
<p>He handed over a sheet torn from a note-book. On it was scribbled<br>in pencil:<br></p>
<p>“£10 Reward.—The number of the cab which dropped a fare at or<br>about the door of the Foreign Office in Charles Street at quarter<br>to ten in the evening of May 23rd. Apply 221B, Baker Street.”<br></p>
<p>“You are confident that the thief came in a cab?”<br></p>
<p>“If not, there is no harm done. But if Mr. Phelps is correct in<br>stating that there is no hiding-place either in the room or the<br>corridors, then the person must have come from outside. If he<br>came from outside on so wet a night, and yet left no trace of<br>damp upon the linoleum, which was examined within a few minutes<br>of his passing, then it is exceeding probable that he came in a<br>cab. Yes, I think that we may safely deduce a cab.”<br></p>
<p>“It sounds plausible.”<br></p>
<p>“That is one of the clues of which I spoke. It may lead us to<br>something. And then, of course, there is the bell—which is the<br>most distinctive feature of the case. Why should the bell ring?<br>Was it the thief who did it out of bravado? Or was it some one<br>who was with the thief who did it in order to prevent the crime?<br>Or was it an accident? Or was it—?” He sank back into the state<br>of intense and silent thought from which he had emerged; but it<br>seemed to me, accustomed as I was to his every mood, that some<br>new possibility had dawned suddenly upon him.<br></p>
<p>It was twenty past three when we reached our terminus, and after<br>a hasty luncheon at the buffet we pushed on at once to Scotland<br>Yard. Holmes had already wired to Forbes, and we found him<br>waiting to receive us—a small, foxy man with a sharp but by no<br>means amiable expression. He was decidedly frigid in his manner<br>to us, especially when he heard the errand upon which we had<br>come.<br></p>
<p>“I’ve heard of your methods before now, Mr. Holmes,” said he,<br>tartly. “You are ready enough to use all the information that the<br>police can lay at your disposal, and then you try to finish the<br>case yourself and bring discredit on them.”<br></p>
<p>“On the contrary,” said Holmes, “out of my last fifty-three cases<br>my name has only appeared in four, and the police have had all<br>the credit in forty-nine. I don’t blame you for not knowing this,<br>for you are young and inexperienced, but if you wish to get on in<br>your new duties you will work with me and not against me.”<br></p>
<p>“I’d be very glad of a hint or two,” said the detective, changing<br>his manner. “I’ve certainly had no credit from the case so far.”<br></p>
<p>“What steps have you taken?”<br></p>
<p>“Tangey, the commissionnaire, has been shadowed. He left the<br>Guards with a good character and we can find nothing against him.<br>His wife is a bad lot, though. I fancy she knows more about this<br>than appears.”<br></p>
<p>“Have you shadowed her?”<br></p>
<p>“We have set one of our women on to her. Mrs. Tangey drinks, and<br>our woman has been with her twice when she was well on, but she<br>could get nothing out of her.”<br></p>
<p>“I understand that they have had brokers in the house?”<br></p>
<p>“Yes, but they were paid off.”<br></p>
<p>“Where did the money come from?”<br></p>
<p>“That was all right. His pension was due. They have not shown any<br>sign of being in funds.”<br></p>
<p>“What explanation did she give of having answered the bell when<br>Mr. Phelps rang for the coffee?”<br></p>
<p>“She said that her husband was very tired and she wished to<br>relieve him.”<br></p>
<p>“Well, certainly that would agree with his being found a little<br>later asleep in his chair. There is nothing against them then but<br>the woman’s character. Did you ask her why she hurried away that<br>night? Her haste attracted the attention of the police<br>constable.”<br></p>
<p>“She was later than usual and wanted to get home.”<br></p>
<p>“Did you point out to her that you and Mr. Phelps, who started at<br>least twenty minutes after her, got home before her?”<br></p>
<p>“She explains that by the difference between a ‘bus and a<br>hansom.”<br></p>
<p>“Did she make it clear why, on reaching her house, she ran into<br>the back kitchen?”<br></p>
<p>“Because she had the money there with which to pay off the<br>brokers.”<br></p>
<p>“She has at least an answer for everything. Did you ask her<br>whether in leaving she met any one or saw any one loitering about<br>Charles Street?”<br></p>
<p>“She saw no one but the constable.”<br></p>
<p>“Well, you seem to have cross-examined her pretty thoroughly.<br>What else have you done?”<br></p>
<p>“The clerk Gorot has been shadowed all these nine weeks, but<br>without result. We can show nothing against him.”<br></p>
<p>“Anything else?”<br></p>
<p>“Well, we have nothing else to go upon—no evidence of any kind.”<br></p>
<p>“Have you formed a theory about how that bell rang?”<br></p>
<p>“Well, I must confess that it beats me. It was a cool hand,<br>whoever it was, to go and give the alarm like that.”<br></p>
<p>“Yes, it was a queer thing to do. Many thanks to you for what you<br>have told me. If I can put the man into your hands you shall hear<br>from me. Come along, Watson.”<br></p>
<p>“Where are we going to now?” I asked, as we left the office.<br></p>
<p>“We are now going to interview Lord Holdhurst, the cabinet<br>minister and future premier of England.”<br></p>
<p>We were fortunate in finding that Lord Holdhurst was still in his<br>chambers in Downing Street, and on Holmes sending in his card we<br>were instantly shown up. The statesman received us with that<br>old-fashioned courtesy for which he is remarkable, and seated us<br>on the two luxuriant lounges on either side of the fireplace.<br>Standing on the rug between us, with his slight, tall figure, his<br>sharp features, thoughtful face, and curling hair prematurely<br>tinged with grey, he seemed to represent that not too common<br>type, a nobleman who is in truth noble.<br></p>
<p>“Your name is very familiar to me, Mr. Holmes,” said he, smiling.<br>“And, of course, I cannot pretend to be ignorant of the object of<br>your visit. There has only been one occurrence in these offices<br>which could call for your attention. In whose interest are you<br>acting, may I ask?”<br></p>
<p>“In that of Mr. Percy Phelps,” answered Holmes.<br></p>
<p>“Ah, my unfortunate nephew! You can understand that our kinship<br>makes it the more impossible for me to screen him in any way. I<br>fear that the incident must have a very prejudicial effect upon<br>his career.”<br></p>
<p>“But if the document is found?”<br></p>
<p>“Ah, that, of course, would be different.”<br></p>
<p>“I had one or two questions which I wished to ask you, Lord<br>Holdhurst.”<br></p>
<p>“I shall be happy to give you any information in my power.”<br></p>
<p>“Was it in this room that you gave your instructions as to the<br>copying of the document?”<br></p>
<p>“It was.”<br></p>
<p>“Then you could hardly have been overheard?”<br></p>
<p>“It is out of the question.”<br></p>
<p>“Did you ever mention to any one that it was your intention to<br>give any one the treaty to be copied?”<br></p>
<p>“Never.”<br></p>
<p>“You are certain of that?”<br></p>
<p>“Absolutely.”<br></p>
<p>“Well, since you never said so, and Mr. Phelps never said so, and<br>nobody else knew anything of the matter, then the thief’s<br>presence in the room was purely accidental. He saw his chance and<br>he took it.”<br></p>
<p>The statesman smiled. “You take me out of my province there,”<br>said he.<br></p>
<p>Holmes considered for a moment. “There is another very important<br>point which I wish to discuss with you,” said he. “You feared, as<br>I understand, that very grave results might follow from the<br>details of this treaty becoming known.”<br></p>
<p>A shadow passed over the expressive face of the statesman. “Very<br>grave results indeed.”<br></p>
<p>“And have they occurred?”<br></p>
<p>“Not yet.”<br></p>
<p>“If the treaty had reached, let us say, the French or Russian<br>Foreign Office, you would expect to hear of it?”<br></p>
<p>“I should,” said Lord Holdhurst, with a wry face.<br></p>
<p>“Since nearly ten weeks have elapsed, then, and nothing has been<br>heard, it is not unfair to suppose that for some reason the<br>treaty has not reached them.”<br></p>
<p>Lord Holdhurst shrugged his shoulders.<br></p>
<p>“We can hardly suppose, Mr. Holmes, that the thief took the<br>treaty in order to frame it and hang it up.”<br></p>
<p>“Perhaps he is waiting for a better price.”<br></p>
<p>“If he waits a little longer he will get no price at all. The<br>treaty will cease to be secret in a few months.”<br></p>
<p>“That is most important,” said Holmes. “Of course, it is a<br>possible supposition that the thief has had a sudden illness—”<br></p>
<p>“An attack of brain-fever, for example?” asked the statesman,<br>flashing a swift glance at him.<br></p>
<p>“I did not say so,” said Holmes, imperturbably. “And now, Lord<br>Holdhurst, we have already taken up too much of your valuable<br>time, and we shall wish you good-day.”<br></p>
<p>“Every success to your investigation, be the criminal who it<br>may,” answered the nobleman, as he bowed us out the door.<br></p>
<p>“He’s a fine fellow,” said Holmes, as we came out into Whitehall.<br>“But he has a struggle to keep up his position. He is far from<br>rich and has many calls. You noticed, of course, that his boots<br>had been resoled. Now, Watson, I won’t detain you from your<br>legitimate work any longer. I shall do nothing more to-day,<br>unless I have an answer to my cab advertisement. But I should be<br>extremely obliged to you if you would come down with me to Woking<br>to-morrow, by the same train which we took yesterday.”<br></p>
<p>I met him accordingly next morning and we travelled down to<br>Woking together. He had had no answer to his advertisement, he<br>said, and no fresh light had been thrown upon the case. He had,<br>when he so willed it, the utter immobility of countenance of a<br>red Indian, and I could not gather from his appearance whether he<br>was satisfied or not with the position of the case. His<br>conversation, I remember, was about the Bertillon system of<br>measurements, and he expressed his enthusiastic admiration of the<br>French savant.<br></p>
<p>We found our client still under the charge of his devoted nurse,<br>but looking considerably better than before. He rose from the<br>sofa and greeted us without difficulty when we entered.<br></p>
<p>“Any news?” he asked, eagerly.<br></p>
<p>“My report, as I expected, is a negative one,” said Holmes. “I<br>have seen Forbes, and I have seen your uncle, and I have set one<br>or two trains of inquiry upon foot which may lead to something.”<br></p>
<p>“You have not lost heart, then?”<br></p>
<p>“By no means.”<br></p>
<p>“God bless you for saying that!” cried Miss Harrison. “If we keep<br>our courage and our patience the truth must come out.”<br></p>
<p>“We have more to tell you than you have for us,” said Phelps,<br>reseating himself upon the couch.<br></p>
<p>“I hoped you might have something.”<br></p>
<p>“Yes, we have had an adventure during the night, and one which<br>might have proved to be a serious one.” His expression grew very<br>grave as he spoke, and a look of something akin to fear sprang up<br>in his eyes. “Do you know,” said he, “that I begin to believe<br>that I am the unconscious centre of some monstrous conspiracy,<br>and that my life is aimed at as well as my honour?”<br></p>
<p>“Ah!” cried Holmes.<br></p>
<p>“It sounds incredible, for I have not, as far as I know, an enemy<br>in the world. Yet from last night’s experience I can come to no<br>other conclusion.”<br></p>
<p>“Pray let me hear it.”<br></p>
<p>“You must know that last night was the very first night that I<br>have ever slept without a nurse in the room. I was so much better<br>that I thought I could dispense with one. I had a night-light<br>burning, however. Well, about two in the morning I had sunk into<br>a light sleep when I was suddenly aroused by a slight noise. It<br>was like the sound which a mouse makes when it is gnawing a<br>plank, and I lay listening to it for some time under the<br>impression that it must come from that cause. Then it grew<br>louder, and suddenly there came from the window a sharp metallic<br>snick. I sat up in amazement. There could be no doubt what the<br>sounds were now. The first ones had been caused by some one<br>forcing an instrument through the slit between the sashes, and<br>the second by the catch being pressed back.<br></p>
<p>“There was a pause then for about ten minutes, as if the person<br>were waiting to see whether the noise had awakened me. Then I<br>heard a gentle creaking as the window was very slowly opened. I<br>could stand it no longer, for my nerves are not what they used to<br>be. I sprang out of bed and flung open the shutters. A man was<br>crouching at the window. I could see little of him, for he was<br>gone like a flash. He was wrapped in some sort of cloak which<br>came across the lower part of his face. One thing only I am sure<br>of, and that is that he had some weapon in his hand. It looked to<br>me like a long knife. I distinctly saw the gleam of it as he<br>turned to run.”<br></p>
<p>“This is most interesting,” said Holmes. “Pray what did you do<br>then?”<br></p>
<p>“I should have followed him through the open window if I had been<br>stronger. As it was, I rang the bell and roused the house. It<br>took me some little time, for the bell rings in the kitchen and<br>the servants all sleep upstairs. I shouted, however, and that<br>brought Joseph down, and he roused the others. Joseph and the<br>groom found marks on the bed outside the window, but the weather<br>has been so dry lately that they found it hopeless to follow the<br>trail across the grass. There’s a place, however, on the wooden<br>fence which skirts the road which shows signs, they tell me, as<br>if some one had got over, and had snapped the top of the rail in<br>doing so. I have said nothing to the local police yet, for I<br>thought I had best have your opinion first.”<br></p>
<p>This tale of our client’s appeared to have an extraordinary<br>effect upon Sherlock Holmes. He rose from his chair and paced<br>about the room in uncontrollable excitement.<br></p>
<p>“Misfortunes never come single,” said Phelps, smiling, though it<br>was evident that his adventure had somewhat shaken him.<br></p>
<p>“You have certainly had your share,” said Holmes. “Do you think<br>you could walk round the house with me?”<br></p>
<p>“Oh, yes, I should like a little sunshine. Joseph will come,<br>too.”<br></p>
<p>“And I also,” said Miss Harrison.<br></p>
<p>“I am afraid not,” said Holmes, shaking his head. “I think I must<br>ask you to remain sitting exactly where you are.”<br></p>
<p>The young lady resumed her seat with an air of displeasure. Her<br>brother, however, had joined us and we set off all four together.<br>We passed round the lawn to the outside of the young<br>diplomatist’s window. There were, as he had said, marks upon the<br>bed, but they were hopelessly blurred and vague. Holmes stopped<br>over them for an instant, and then rose shrugging his shoulders.<br></p>
<p>“I don’t think any one could make much of this,” said he. “Let us<br>go round the house and see why this particular room was chosen by<br>the burglar. I should have thought those larger windows of the<br>drawing-room and dining-room would have had more attractions for<br>him.”<br></p>
<p>“They are more visible from the road,” suggested Mr. Joseph<br>Harrison.<br></p>
<p>“Ah, yes, of course. There is a door here which he might have<br>attempted. What is it for?”<br></p>
<p>“It is the side entrance for trades-people. Of course it is<br>locked at night.”<br></p>
<p>“Have you ever had an alarm like this before?”<br></p>
<p>“Never,” said our client.<br></p>
<p>“Do you keep plate in the house, or anything to attract<br>burglars?”<br></p>
<p>“Nothing of value.”<br></p>
<p>Holmes strolled round the house with his hands in his pockets and<br>a negligent air which was unusual with him.<br></p>
<p>“By the way,” said he to Joseph Harrison, “you found some place,<br>I understand, where the fellow scaled the fence. Let us have a<br>look at that!”<br></p>
<p>The plump young man led us to a spot where the top of one of the<br>wooden rails had been cracked. A small fragment of the wood was<br>hanging down. Holmes pulled it off and examined it critically.<br></p>
<p>“Do you think that was done last night? It looks rather old, does<br>it not?”<br></p>
<p>“Well, possibly so.”<br></p>
<p>“There are no marks of any one jumping down upon the other side.<br>No, I fancy we shall get no help here. Let us go back to the<br>bedroom and talk the matter over.”<br></p>
<p>Percy Phelps was walking very slowly, leaning upon the arm of his<br>future brother-in-law. Holmes walked swiftly across the lawn, and<br>we were at the open window of the bedroom long before the others<br>came up.<br></p>
<p>“Miss Harrison,” said Holmes, speaking with the utmost intensity<br>of manner, “you must stay where you are all day. Let nothing<br>prevent you from staying where you are all day. It is of the<br>utmost importance.”<br></p>
<p>“Certainly, if you wish it, Mr. Holmes,” said the girl in<br>astonishment.<br></p>
<p>“When you go to bed lock the door of this room on the outside and<br>keep the key. Promise to do this.”<br></p>
<p>“But Percy?”<br></p>
<p>“He will come to London with us.”<br></p>
<p>“And am I to remain here?”<br></p>
<p>“It is for his sake. You can serve him. Quick! Promise!”<br></p>
<p>She gave a quick nod of assent just as the other two came up.<br></p>
<p>“Why do you sit moping there, Annie?” cried her brother. “Come<br>out into the sunshine!”<br></p>
<p>“No, thank you, Joseph. I have a slight headache and this room is<br>deliciously cool and soothing.”<br></p>
<p>“What do you propose now, Mr. Holmes?” asked our client.<br></p>
<p>“Well, in investigating this minor affair we must not lose sight<br>of our main inquiry. It would be a very great help to me if you<br>would come up to London with us.”<br></p>
<p>“At once?”<br></p>
<p>“Well, as soon as you conveniently can. Say in an hour.”<br></p>
<p>“I feel quite strong enough, if I can really be of any help.”<br></p>
<p>“The greatest possible.”<br></p>
<p>“Perhaps you would like me to stay there to-night?”<br></p>
<p>“I was just going to propose it.”<br></p>
<p>“Then, if my friend of the night comes to revisit me, he will<br>find the bird flown. We are all in your hands, Mr. Holmes, and<br>you must tell us exactly what you would like done. Perhaps you<br>would prefer that Joseph came with us so as to look after me?”<br></p>
<p>“Oh, no; my friend Watson is a medical man, you know, and he’ll<br>look after you. We’ll have our lunch here, if you will permit us,<br>and then we shall all three set off for town together.”<br></p>
<p>It was arranged as he suggested, though Miss Harrison excused<br>herself from leaving the bedroom, in accordance with Holmes’s<br>suggestion. What the object of my friend’s manœuvres was I could<br>not conceive, unless it were to keep the lady away from Phelps,<br>who, rejoiced by his returning health and by the prospect of<br>action, lunched with us in the dining-room. Holmes had a still<br>more startling surprise for us, however, for, after accompanying<br>us down to the station and seeing us into our carriage, he calmly<br>announced that he had no intention of leaving Woking.<br></p>
<p>“There are one or two small points which I should desire to clear<br>up before I go,” said he. “Your absence, Mr. Phelps, will in some<br>ways rather assist me. Watson, when you reach London you would<br>oblige me by driving at once to Baker Street with our friend<br>here, and remaining with him until I see you again. It is<br>fortunate that you are old schoolfellows, as you must have much<br>to talk over. Mr. Phelps can have the spare bedroom to-night, and<br>I will be with you in time for breakfast, for there is a train<br>which will take me into Waterloo at eight.”<br></p>
<p>“But how about our investigation in London?” asked Phelps,<br>ruefully.<br></p>
<p>“We can do that to-morrow. I think that just at present I can be<br>of more immediate use here.”<br></p>
<p>“You might tell them at Briarbrae that I hope to be back<br>to-morrow night,” cried Phelps, as we began to move from the<br>platform.<br></p>
<p>“I hardly expect to go back to Briarbrae,” answered Holmes, and<br>waved his hand to us cheerily as we shot out from the station.<br></p>
<p>Phelps and I talked it over on our journey, but neither of us<br>could devise a satisfactory reason for this new development.<br></p>
<p>“I suppose he wants to find out some clue as to the burglary last<br>night, if a burglar it was. For myself, I don’t believe it was an<br>ordinary thief.”<br></p>
<p>“What is your own idea, then?”<br></p>
<p>“Upon my word, you may put it down to my weak nerves or not, but<br>I believe there is some deep political intrigue going on around<br>me, and that for some reason that passes my understanding my life<br>is aimed at by the conspirators. It sounds high-flown and absurd,<br>but consider the facts! Why should a thief try to break in at a<br>bedroom window, where there could be no hope of any plunder, and<br>why should he come with a long knife in his hand?”<br></p>
<p>“You are sure it was not a house-breaker’s jimmy?”<br></p>
<p>“Oh, no, it was a knife. I saw the flash of the blade quite<br>distinctly.”<br></p>
<p>“But why on earth should you be pursued with such animosity?”<br></p>
<p>“Ah, that is the question.”<br></p>
<p>“Well, if Holmes takes the same view, that would account for his<br>action, would it not? Presuming that your theory is correct, if<br>he can lay his hands upon the man who threatened you last night<br>he will have gone a long way towards finding who took the naval<br>treaty. It is absurd to suppose that you have two enemies, one of<br>whom robs you, while the other threatens your life.”<br></p>
<p>“But Holmes said that he was not going to Briarbrae.”<br></p>
<p>“I have known him for some time,” said I, “but I never knew him<br>do anything yet without a very good reason,” and with that our<br>conversation drifted off on to other topics.<br></p>
<p>But it was a weary day for me. Phelps was still weak after his<br>long illness, and his misfortune made him querulous and nervous.<br>In vain I endeavoured to interest him in Afghanistan, in India,<br>in social questions, in anything which might take his mind out of<br>the groove. He would always come back to his lost treaty,<br>wondering, guessing, speculating, as to what Holmes was doing,<br>what steps Lord Holdhurst was taking, what news we should have in<br>the morning. As the evening wore on his excitement became quite<br>painful.<br></p>
<p>“You have implicit faith in Holmes?” he asked.<br></p>
<p>“I have seen him do some remarkable things.”<br></p>
<p>“But he never brought light into anything quite so dark as this?”<br></p>
<p>“Oh, yes; I have known him solve questions which presented fewer<br>clues than yours.”<br></p>
<p>“But not where such large interests are at stake?”<br></p>
<p>“I don’t know that. To my certain knowledge he has acted on<br>behalf of three of the reigning houses of Europe in very vital<br>matters.”<br></p>
<p>“But you know him well, Watson. He is such an inscrutable fellow<br>that I never quite know what to make of him. Do you think he is<br>hopeful? Do you think he expects to make a success of it?”<br></p>
<p>“He has said nothing.”<br></p>
<p>“That is a bad sign.”<br></p>
<p>“On the contrary, I have noticed that when he is off the trail he<br>generally says so. It is when he is on a scent and is not quite<br>absolutely sure yet that it is the right one that he is most<br>taciturn. Now, my dear fellow, we can’t help matters by making<br>ourselves nervous about them, so let me implore you to go to bed<br>and so be fresh for whatever may await us to-morrow.”<br></p>
<p>I was able at last to persuade my companion to take my advice,<br>though I knew from his excited manner that there was not much<br>hope of sleep for him. Indeed, his mood was infectious, for I lay<br>tossing half the night myself, brooding over this strange<br>problem, and inventing a hundred theories, each of which was more<br>impossible than the last. Why had Holmes remained at Woking? Why<br>had he asked Miss Harrison to remain in the sick-room all day?<br>Why had he been so careful not to inform the people at Briarbrae<br>that he intended to remain near them? I cudgelled my brains until<br>I fell asleep in the endeavour to find some explanation which<br>would cover all these facts.<br></p>
<p>It was seven o’clock when I awoke, and I set off at once for<br>Phelps’s room, to find him haggard and spent after a sleepless<br>night. His first question was whether Holmes had arrived yet.<br></p>
<p>“He’ll be here when he promised,” said I, “and not an instant<br>sooner or later.”<br></p>
<p>And my words were true, for shortly after eight a hansom dashed<br>up to the door and our friend got out of it. Standing in the<br>window we saw that his left hand was swathed in a bandage and<br>that his face was very grim and pale. He entered the house, but<br>it was some little time before he came upstairs.<br></p>
<p>“He looks like a beaten man,” cried Phelps.<br></p>
<p>I was forced to confess that he was right. “After all,” said I,<br>“the clue of the matter lies probably here in town.”<br></p>
<p>Phelps gave a groan.<br></p>
<p>“I don’t know how it is,” said he, “but I had hoped for so much<br>from his return. But surely his hand was not tied up like that<br>yesterday. What can be the matter?”<br></p>
<p>“You are not wounded, Holmes?” I asked, as my friend entered the<br>room.<br></p>
<p>“Tut, it is only a scratch through my own clumsiness,” he<br>answered, nodding his good-mornings to us. “This case of yours,<br>Mr. Phelps, is certainly one of the darkest which I have ever<br>investigated.”<br></p>
<p>“I feared that you would find it beyond you.”<br></p>
<p>“It has been a most remarkable experience.”<br></p>
<p>“That bandage tells of adventures,” said I. “Won’t you tell us<br>what has happened?”<br></p>
<p>“After breakfast, my dear Watson. Remember that I have breathed<br>thirty miles of Surrey air this morning. I suppose that there has<br>been no answer from my cabman advertisement? Well, well, we<br>cannot expect to score every time.”<br></p>
<p>The table was all laid, and just as I was about to ring Mrs.<br>Hudson entered with the tea and coffee. A few minutes later she<br>brought in three covers, and we all drew up to the table, Holmes<br>ravenous, I curious, and Phelps in the gloomiest state of<br>depression.<br></p>
<p>“Mrs. Hudson has risen to the occasion,” said Holmes, uncovering<br>a dish of curried chicken. “Her cuisine is a little limited, but<br>she has as good an idea of breakfast as a Scotch-woman. What have<br>you here, Watson?”<br></p>
<p>“Ham and eggs,” I answered.<br></p>
<p>“Good! What are you going to take, Mr. Phelps—curried fowl or<br>eggs, or will you help yourself?”<br></p>
<p>“Thank you. I can eat nothing,” said Phelps.<br></p>
<p>“Oh, come! Try the dish before you.”<br></p>
<p>“Thank you, I would really rather not.”<br></p>
<p>“Well, then,” said Holmes, with a mischievous twinkle, “I suppose<br>that you have no objection to helping me?”<br></p>
<p>Phelps raised the cover, and as he did so he uttered a scream,<br>and sat there staring with a face as white as the plate upon<br>which he looked. Across the centre of it was lying a little<br>cylinder of blue-grey paper. He caught it up, devoured it with<br>his eyes, and then danced madly about the room, pressing it to<br>his bosom and shrieking out in his delight. Then he fell back<br>into an armchair so limp and exhausted with his own emotions that<br>we had to pour brandy down his throat to keep him from fainting.<br></p>
<p>“There! there!” said Holmes, soothing, patting him upon the<br>shoulder. “It was too bad to spring it on you like this, but<br>Watson here will tell you that I never can resist a touch of the<br>dramatic.”<br></p>
<p>Phelps seized his hand and kissed it. “God bless you!” he cried.<br>“You have saved my honour.”<br></p>
<p>“Well, my own was at stake, you know,” said Holmes. “I assure you<br>it is just as hateful to me to fail in a case as it can be to you<br>to blunder over a commission.”<br></p>
<p>Phelps thrust away the precious document into the innermost<br>pocket of his coat.<br></p>
<p>“I have not the heart to interrupt your breakfast any further,<br>and yet I am dying to know how you got it and where it was.”<br></p>
<p>Sherlock Holmes swallowed a cup of coffee, and turned his<br>attention to the ham and eggs. Then he rose, lit his pipe, and<br>settled himself down into his chair.<br></p>
<p>“I’ll tell you what I did first, and how I came to do it<br>afterwards,” said he. “After leaving you at the station I went<br>for a charming walk through some admirable Surrey scenery to a<br>pretty little village called Ripley, where I had my tea at an<br>inn, and took the precaution of filling my flask and of putting a<br>paper of sandwiches in my pocket. There I remained until evening,<br>when I set off for Woking again, and found myself in the<br>high-road outside Briarbrae just after sunset.<br></p>
<p>“Well, I waited until the road was clear—it is never a very<br>frequented one at any time, I fancy—and then I clambered over the<br>fence into the grounds.”<br></p>
<p>“Surely the gate was open!” ejaculated Phelps.<br></p>
<p>“Yes, but I have a peculiar taste in these matters. I chose the<br>place where the three fir-trees stand, and behind their screen I<br>got over without the least chance of any one in the house being<br>able to see me. I crouched down among the bushes on the other<br>side, and crawled from one to the other—witness the disreputable<br>state of my trouser knees—until I had reached the clump of<br>rhododendrons just opposite to your bedroom window. There I<br>squatted down and awaited developments.<br></p>
<p>“The blind was not down in your room, and I could see Miss<br>Harrison sitting there reading by the table. It was quarter-past<br>ten when she closed her book, fastened the shutters, and retired.<br></p>
<p>“I heard her shut the door, and felt quite sure that she had<br>turned the key in the lock.”<br></p>
<p>“The key!” ejaculated Phelps.<br></p>
<p>“Yes; I had given Miss Harrison instructions to lock the door on<br>the outside and take the key with her when she went to bed. She<br>carried out every one of my injunctions to the letter, and<br>certainly without her co-operation you would not have that paper<br>in your coat-pocket. She departed then and the lights went out,<br>and I was left squatting in the rhododendron-bush.<br></p>
<p>“The night was fine, but still it was a very weary vigil. Of<br>course it has the sort of excitement about it that the sportsman<br>feels when he lies beside the water-course and waits for the big<br>game. It was very long, though—almost as long, Watson, as when<br>you and I waited in that deadly room when we looked into the<br>little problem of the Speckled Band. There was a church-clock<br>down at Woking which struck the quarters, and I thought more than<br>once that it had stopped. At last however about two in the<br>morning, I suddenly heard the gentle sound of a bolt being pushed<br>back and the creaking of a key. A moment later the servants’ door<br>was opened, and Mr. Joseph Harrison stepped out into the<br>moonlight.”<br></p>
<p>“Joseph!” ejaculated Phelps.<br></p>
<p>“He was bare-headed, but he had a black coat thrown over his<br>shoulder so that he could conceal his face in an instant if there<br>were any alarm. He walked on tiptoe under the shadow of the wall,<br>and when he reached the window he worked a long-bladed knife<br>through the sash and pushed back the catch. Then he flung open<br>the window, and putting his knife through the crack in the<br>shutters, he thrust the bar up and swung them open.<br></p>
<p>“From where I lay I had a perfect view of the inside of the room<br>and of every one of his movements. He lit the two candles which<br>stood upon the mantelpiece, and then he proceeded to turn back<br>the corner of the carpet in the neighbourhood of the door.<br>Presently he stopped and picked out a square piece of board, such<br>as is usually left to enable plumbers to get at the joints of the<br>gas-pipes. This one covered, as a matter of fact, the T joint<br>which gives off the pipe which supplies the kitchen underneath.<br>Out of this hiding-place he drew that little cylinder of paper,<br>pushed down the board, rearranged the carpet, blew out the<br>candles, and walked straight into my arms as I stood waiting for<br>him outside the window.<br></p>
<p>“Well, he has rather more viciousness than I gave him credit for,<br>has Master Joseph. He flew at me with his knife, and I had to<br>grasp him twice, and got a cut over the knuckles, before I had<br>the upper hand of him. He looked murder out of the only eye he<br>could see with when we had finished, but he listened to reason<br>and gave up the papers. Having got them I let my man go, but I<br>wired full particulars to Forbes this morning. If he is quick<br>enough to catch his bird, well and good. But if, as I shrewdly<br>suspect, he finds the nest empty before he gets there, why, all<br>the better for the government. I fancy that Lord Holdhurst for<br>one, and Mr. Percy Phelps for another, would very much rather<br>that the affair never got as far as a police-court.<br></p>
<p>“My God!” gasped our client. “Do you tell me that during these<br>long ten weeks of agony the stolen papers were within the very<br>room with me all the time?”<br></p>
<p>“So it was.”<br></p>
<p>“And Joseph! Joseph a villain and a thief!”<br></p>
<p>“Hum! I am afraid Joseph’s character is a rather deeper and more<br>dangerous one than one might judge from his appearance. From what<br>I have heard from him this morning, I gather that he has lost<br>heavily in dabbling with stocks, and that he is ready to do<br>anything on earth to better his fortunes. Being an absolutely<br>selfish man, when a chance presented itself he did not allow<br>either his sister’s happiness or your reputation to hold his<br>hand.”<br></p>
<p>Percy Phelps sank back in his chair. “My head whirls,” said he.<br>“Your words have dazed me.”<br></p>
<p>“The principal difficulty in your case,” remarked Holmes, in his<br>didactic fashion, “lay in the fact of there being too much<br>evidence. What was vital was overlaid and hidden by what was<br>irrelevant. Of all the facts which were presented to us we had to<br>pick just those which we deemed to be essential, and then piece<br>them together in their order, so as to reconstruct this very<br>remarkable chain of events. I had already begun to suspect<br>Joseph, from the fact that you had intended to travel home with<br>him that night, and that therefore it was a likely enough thing<br>that he should call for you, knowing the Foreign Office well,<br>upon his way. When I heard that some one had been so anxious to<br>get into the bedroom, in which no one but Joseph could have<br>concealed anything—you told us in your narrative how you had<br>turned Joseph out when you arrived with the doctor—my suspicions<br>all changed to certainties, especially as the attempt was made on<br>the first night upon which the nurse was absent, showing that the<br>intruder was well acquainted with the ways of the house.”<br></p>
<p>“How blind I have been!”<br></p>
<p>“The facts of the case, as far as I have worked them out, are<br>these: this Joseph Harrison entered the office through the<br>Charles Street door, and knowing his way he walked straight into<br>your room the instant after you left it. Finding no one there he<br>promptly rang the bell, and at the instant that he did so his<br>eyes caught the paper upon the table. A glance showed him that<br>chance had put in his way a State document of immense value, and<br>in an instant he had thrust it into his pocket and was gone. A<br>few minutes elapsed, as you remember, before the sleepy<br>commissionnaire drew your attention to the bell, and those were<br>just enough to give the thief time to make his escape.<br></p>
<p>“He made his way to Woking by the first train, and having<br>examined his booty and assured himself that it really was of<br>immense value, he had concealed it in what he thought was a very<br>safe place, with the intention of taking it out again in a day or<br>two, and carrying it to the French embassy, or wherever he<br>thought that a long price was to be had. Then came your sudden<br>return. He, without a moment’s warning, was bundled out of his<br>room, and from that time onward there were always at least two of<br>you there to prevent him from regaining his treasure. The<br>situation to him must have been a maddening one. But at last he<br>thought he saw his chance. He tried to steal in, but was baffled<br>by your wakefulness. You remember that you did not take your<br>usual draught that night.”<br></p>
<p>“I remember.”<br></p>
<p>“I fancy that he had taken steps to make that draught<br>efficacious, and that he quite relied upon your being<br>unconscious. Of course, I understood that he would repeat the<br>attempt whenever it could be done with safety. Your leaving the<br>room gave him the chance he wanted. I kept Miss Harrison in it<br>all day so that he might not anticipate us. Then, having given<br>him the idea that the coast was clear, I kept guard as I have<br>described. I already knew that the papers were probably in the<br>room, but I had no desire to rip up all the planking and skirting<br>in search of them. I let him take them, therefore, from the<br>hiding-place, and so saved myself an infinity of trouble. Is<br>there any other point which I can make clear?”<br></p>
<p>“Why did he try the window on the first occasion,” I asked, “when<br>he might have entered by the door?”<br></p>
<p>“In reaching the door he would have to pass seven bedrooms. On<br>the other hand, he could get out on to the lawn with ease.<br>Anything else?”<br></p>
<p>“You do not think,” asked Phelps, “that he had any murderous<br>intention? The knife was only meant as a tool.”<br></p>
<p>“It may be so,” answered Holmes, shrugging his shoulders. “I can<br>only say for certain that Mr. Joseph Harrison is a gentleman to<br>whose mercy I should be extremely unwilling to trust.”<br></p>
