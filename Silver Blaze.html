        <h1>Silver Blaze</h1>
        <p>I am afraid, Watson, that I shall have to go,” said Holmes, as we<br>sat down together to our breakfast one morning.<br></p>
<p>“Go! Where to?”<br></p>
<p>“To Dartmoor; to King’s Pyland.”<br></p>
<p>I was not surprised. Indeed, my only wonder was that he had not<br>already been mixed up in this extraordinary case, which was the<br>one topic of conversation through the length and breadth of<br>England. For a whole day my companion had rambled about the room<br>with his chin upon his chest and his brows knitted, charging and<br>recharging his pipe with the strongest black tobacco, and<br>absolutely deaf to any of my questions or remarks. Fresh editions<br>of every paper had been sent up by our news agent, only to be<br>glanced over and tossed down into a corner. Yet, silent as he<br>was, I knew perfectly well what it was over which he was<br>brooding. There was but one problem before the public which could<br>challenge his powers of analysis, and that was the singular<br>disappearance of the favourite for the Wessex Cup, and the tragic<br>murder of its trainer. When, therefore, he suddenly announced his<br>intention of setting out for the scene of the drama it was only<br>what I had both expected and hoped for.<br></p>
<p>“I should be most happy to go down with you if I should not be in<br>the way,” said I.<br></p>
<p>“My dear Watson, you would confer a great favour upon me by<br>coming. And I think that your time will not be misspent, for<br>there are points about the case which promise to make it an<br>absolutely unique one. We have, I think, just time to catch our<br>train at Paddington, and I will go further into the matter upon<br>our journey. You would oblige me by bringing with you your very<br>excellent field-glass.”<br></p>
<p>And so it happened that an hour or so later I found myself in the<br>corner of a first-class carriage flying along en route for<br>Exeter, while Sherlock Holmes, with his sharp, eager face framed<br>in his ear-flapped travelling-cap, dipped rapidly into the bundle<br>of fresh papers which he had procured at Paddington. We had left<br>Reading far behind us before he thrust the last one of them under<br>the seat, and offered me his cigar-case.<br></p>
<p>“We are going well,” said he, looking out the window and glancing<br>at his watch. “Our rate at present is fifty-three and a half<br>miles an hour.”<br></p>
<p>“I have not observed the quarter-mile posts,” said I.<br></p>
<p>“Nor have I. But the telegraph posts upon this line are sixty<br>yards apart, and the calculation is a simple one. I presume that<br>you have looked into this matter of the murder of John Straker<br>and the disappearance of Silver Blaze?”<br></p>
<p>“I have seen what the _Telegraph_ and the _Chronicle_ have to<br>say.”<br></p>
<p>“It is one of those cases where the art of the reasoner should be<br>used rather for the sifting of details than for the acquiring of<br>fresh evidence. The tragedy has been so uncommon, so complete and<br>of such personal importance to so many people, that we are<br>suffering from a plethora of surmise, conjecture, and hypothesis.<br>The difficulty is to detach the framework of fact—of absolute<br>undeniable fact—from the embellishments of theorists and<br>reporters. Then, having established ourselves upon this sound<br>basis, it is our duty to see what inferences may be drawn and<br>what are the special points upon which the whole mystery turns.<br>On Tuesday evening I received telegrams from both Colonel Ross,<br>the owner of the horse, and from Inspector Gregory, who is<br>looking after the case, inviting my co-operation.”<br></p>
<p>“Tuesday evening!” I exclaimed. “And this is Thursday morning.<br>Why didn’t you go down yesterday?”<br></p>
<p>“Because I made a blunder, my dear Watson—which is, I am afraid,<br>a more common occurrence than any one would think who only knew<br>me through your memoirs. The fact is that I could not believe it<br>possible that the most remarkable horse in England could long<br>remain concealed, especially in so sparsely inhabited a place as<br>the north of Dartmoor. From hour to hour yesterday I expected to<br>hear that he had been found, and that his abductor was the<br>murderer of John Straker. When, however, another morning had<br>come, and I found that beyond the arrest of young Fitzroy Simpson<br>nothing had been done, I felt that it was time for me to take<br>action. Yet in some ways I feel that yesterday has not been<br>wasted.”<br></p>
<p>“You have formed a theory, then?”<br></p>
<p>“At least I have got a grip of the essential facts of the case. I<br>shall enumerate them to you, for nothing clears up a case so much<br>as stating it to another person, and I can hardly expect your<br>co-operation if I do not show you the position from which we<br>start.”<br></p>
<p>I lay back against the cushions, puffing at my cigar, while<br>Holmes, leaning forward, with his long, thin forefinger checking<br>off the points upon the palm of his left hand, gave me a sketch<br>of the events which had led to our journey.<br></p>
<p>“Silver Blaze,” said he, “is from the Isonomy stock, and holds as<br>brilliant a record as his famous ancestor. He is now in his fifth<br>year, and has brought in turn each of the prizes of the turf to<br>Colonel Ross, his fortunate owner. Up to the time of the<br>catastrophe he was the first favourite for the Wessex Cup, the<br>betting being three to one on him. He has always, however, been a<br>prime favourite with the racing public, and has never yet<br>disappointed them, so that even at those odds enormous sums of<br>money have been laid upon him. It is obvious, therefore, that<br>there were many people who had the strongest interest in<br>preventing Silver Blaze from being there at the fall of the flag<br>next Tuesday.<br></p>
<p>“The fact was, of course, appreciated at King’s Pyland, where the<br>Colonel’s training-stable is situated. Every precaution was taken<br>to guard the favourite. The trainer, John Straker, is a retired<br>jockey who rode in Colonel Ross’s colours before he became too<br>heavy for the weighing-chair. He has served the Colonel for five<br>years as jockey and for seven as trainer, and has always shown<br>himself to be a zealous and honest servant. Under him were three<br>lads; for the establishment was a small one, containing only four<br>horses in all. One of these lads sat up each night in the stable,<br>while the others slept in the loft. All three bore excellent<br>characters. John Straker, who is a married man, lived in a small<br>villa about two hundred yards from the stables. He has no<br>children, keeps one maid-servant, and is comfortably off. The<br>country round is very lonely, but about half a mile to the north<br>there is a small cluster of villas which have been built by a<br>Tavistock contractor for the use of invalids and others who may<br>wish to enjoy the pure Dartmoor air. Tavistock itself lies two<br>miles to the west, while across the moor, also about two miles<br>distant, is the larger training establishment of Mapleton, which<br>belongs to Lord Backwater, and is managed by Silas Brown. In<br>every other direction the moor is a complete wilderness,<br>inhabited only by a few roaming gypsies. Such was the general<br>situation last Monday night when the catastrophe occurred.<br></p>
<p>“On that evening the horses had been exercised and watered as<br>usual, and the stables were locked up at nine o’clock. Two of the<br>lads walked up to the trainer’s house, where they had supper in<br>the kitchen, while the third, Ned Hunter, remained on guard. At a<br>few minutes after nine the maid, Edith Baxter, carried down to<br>the stables his supper, which consisted of a dish of curried<br>mutton. She took no liquid, as there was a water-tap in the<br>stables, and it was the rule that the lad on duty should drink<br>nothing else. The maid carried a lantern with her, as it was very<br>dark and the path ran across the open moor.<br></p>
<p>“Edith Baxter was within thirty yards of the stables, when a man<br>appeared out of the darkness and called to her to stop. As he<br>stepped into the circle of yellow light thrown by the lantern she<br>saw that he was a person of gentlemanly bearing, dressed in a<br>grey suit of tweeds, with a cloth cap. He wore gaiters, and<br>carried a heavy stick with a knob to it. She was most impressed,<br>however, by the extreme pallor of his face and by the nervousness<br>of his manner. His age, she thought, would be rather over thirty<br>than under it.<br></p>
<p>“‘Can you tell me where I am?’ he asked. ‘I had almost made up my<br>mind to sleep on the moor, when I saw the light of your lantern.’<br></p>
<p>“‘You are close to the King’s Pyland training-stables,’ said she.<br></p>
<p>“‘Oh, indeed! What a stroke of luck!’ he cried. ‘I understand<br>that a stable-boy sleeps there alone every night. Perhaps that is<br>his supper which you are carrying to him. Now I am sure that you<br>would not be too proud to earn the price of a new dress, would<br>you?’ He took a piece of white paper folded up out of his<br>waistcoat pocket. ‘See that the boy has this to-night, and you<br>shall have the prettiest frock that money can buy.’<br></p>
<p>“She was frightened by the earnestness of his manner, and ran<br>past him to the window through which she was accustomed to hand<br>the meals. It was already opened, and Hunter was seated at the<br>small table inside. She had begun to tell him of what had<br>happened, when the stranger came up again.<br></p>
<p>“‘Good-evening,’ said he, looking through the window. ‘I wanted<br>to have a word with you.’ The girl has sworn that as he spoke she<br>noticed the corner of the little paper packet protruding from his<br>closed hand.<br></p>
<p>“‘What business have you here?’ asked the lad.<br></p>
<p>“‘It’s business that may put something into your pocket,’ said<br>the other. ‘You’ve two horses in for the Wessex Cup—Silver Blaze<br>and Bayard. Let me have the straight tip and you won’t be a<br>loser. Is it a fact that at the weights Bayard could give the<br>other a hundred yards in five furlongs, and that the stable have<br>put their money on him?’<br></p>
<p>“‘So, you’re one of those damned touts!’ cried the lad. ‘I’ll<br>show you how we serve them in King’s Pyland.’ He sprang up and<br>rushed across the stable to unloose the dog. The girl fled away<br>to the house, but as she ran she looked back and saw that the<br>stranger was leaning through the window. A minute later, however,<br>when Hunter rushed out with the hound he was gone, and though he<br>ran all round the buildings he failed to find any trace of him.”<br></p>
<p>“One moment,” I asked. “Did the stable-boy, when he ran out with<br>the dog, leave the door unlocked behind him?”<br></p>
<p>“Excellent, Watson, excellent!” murmured my companion. “The<br>importance of the point struck me so forcibly that I sent a<br>special wire to Dartmoor yesterday to clear the matter up. The<br>boy locked the door before he left it. The window, I may add, was<br>not large enough for a man to get through.<br></p>
<p>“Hunter waited until his fellow-grooms had returned, when he sent<br>a message to the trainer and told him what had occurred. Straker<br>was excited at hearing the account, although he does not seem to<br>have quite realized its true significance. It left him, however,<br>vaguely uneasy, and Mrs. Straker, waking at one in the morning,<br>found that he was dressing. In reply to her inquiries, he said<br>that he could not sleep on account of his anxiety about the<br>horses, and that he intended to walk down to the stables to see<br>that all was well. She begged him to remain at home, as she could<br>hear the rain pattering against the window, but in spite of her<br>entreaties he pulled on his large mackintosh and left the house.<br></p>
<p>“Mrs. Straker awoke at seven in the morning, to find that her<br>husband had not yet returned. She dressed herself hastily, called<br>the maid, and set off for the stables. The door was open; inside,<br>huddled together upon a chair, Hunter was sunk in a state of<br>absolute stupor, the favourite’s stall was empty, and there were<br>no signs of his trainer.<br></p>
<p>“The two lads who slept in the chaff-cutting loft above the<br>harness-room were quickly aroused. They had heard nothing during<br>the night, for they are both sound sleepers. Hunter was obviously<br>under the influence of some powerful drug, and as no sense could<br>be got out of him, he was left to sleep it off while the two lads<br>and the two women ran out in search of the absentees. They still<br>had hopes that the trainer had for some reason taken out the<br>horse for early exercise, but on ascending the knoll near the<br>house, from which all the neighbouring moors were visible, they<br>not only could see no signs of the missing favourite, but they<br>perceived something which warned them that they were in the<br>presence of a tragedy.<br></p>
<p>“About a quarter of a mile from the stables John Straker’s<br>overcoat was flapping from a furze-bush. Immediately beyond there<br>was a bowl-shaped depression in the moor, and at the bottom of<br>this was found the dead body of the unfortunate trainer. His head<br>had been shattered by a savage blow from some heavy weapon, and<br>he was wounded on the thigh, where there was a long, clean cut,<br>inflicted evidently by some very sharp instrument. It was clear,<br>however, that Straker had defended himself vigorously against his<br>assailants, for in his right hand he held a small knife, which<br>was clotted with blood up to the handle, while in his left he<br>clasped a red and black silk cravat, which was recognised by the<br>maid as having been worn on the preceding evening by the stranger<br>who had visited the stables.<br></p>
<p>“Hunter, on recovering from his stupor, was also quite positive<br>as to the ownership of the cravat. He was equally certain that<br>the same stranger had, while standing at the window, drugged his<br>curried mutton, and so deprived the stables of their watchman.<br></p>
<p>“As to the missing horse, there were abundant proofs in the mud<br>which lay at the bottom of the fatal hollow that he had been<br>there at the time of the struggle. But from that morning he has<br>disappeared, and although a large reward has been offered, and<br>all the gypsies of Dartmoor are on the alert, no news has come of<br>him. Finally, an analysis has shown that the remains of his<br>supper left by the stable-lad contain an appreciable quantity of<br>powdered opium, while the people at the house partook of the same<br>dish on the same night without any ill effect.<br></p>
<p>“Those are the main facts of the case, stripped of all surmise,<br>and stated as baldly as possible. I shall now recapitulate what<br>the police have done in the matter.<br></p>
<p>“Inspector Gregory, to whom the case has been committed, is an<br>extremely competent officer. Were he but gifted with imagination<br>he might rise to great heights in his profession. On his arrival<br>he promptly found and arrested the man upon whom suspicion<br>naturally rested. There was little difficulty in finding him, for<br>he inhabited one of those villas which I have mentioned. His<br>name, it appears, was Fitzroy Simpson. He was a man of excellent<br>birth and education, who had squandered a fortune upon the turf,<br>and who lived now by doing a little quiet and genteel book-making<br>in the sporting clubs of London. An examination of his<br>betting-book shows that bets to the amount of five thousand<br>pounds had been registered by him against the favourite.<br></p>
<p>“On being arrested he volunteered the statement that he had come<br>down to Dartmoor in the hope of getting some information about<br>the King’s Pyland horses, and also about Desborough, the second<br>favourite, which was in charge of Silas Brown at the Mapleton<br>stables. He did not attempt to deny that he had acted as<br>described upon the evening before, but declared that he had no<br>sinister designs, and had simply wished to obtain first-hand<br>information. When confronted with his cravat, he turned very<br>pale, and was utterly unable to account for its presence in the<br>hand of the murdered man. His wet clothing showed that he had<br>been out in the storm of the night before, and his stick, which<br>was a Penang-lawyer weighted with lead, was just such a weapon as<br>might, by repeated blows, have inflicted the terrible injuries to<br>which the trainer had succumbed.<br></p>
<p>“On the other hand, there was no wound upon his person, while the<br>state of Straker’s knife would show that one at least of his<br>assailants must bear his mark upon him. There you have it all in<br>a nutshell, Watson, and if you can give me any light I shall be<br>infinitely obliged to you.”<br></p>
<p>I had listened with the greatest interest to the statement which<br>Holmes, with characteristic clearness, had laid before me. Though<br>most of the facts were familiar to me, I had not sufficiently<br>appreciated their relative importance, nor their connection to<br>each other.<br></p>
<p>“Is it not possible,” I suggested, “that the incised wound upon<br>Straker may have been caused by his own knife in the convulsive<br>struggles which follow any brain injury?”<br></p>
<p>“It is more than possible; it is probable,” said Holmes. “In that<br>case one of the main points in favour of the accused disappears.”<br></p>
<p>“And yet,” said I, “even now I fail to understand what the theory<br>of the police can be.”<br></p>
<p>“I am afraid that whatever theory we state has very grave<br>objections to it,” returned my companion. “The police imagine, I<br>take it, that this Fitzroy Simpson, having drugged the lad, and<br>having in some way obtained a duplicate key, opened the stable<br>door and took out the horse, with the intention, apparently, of<br>kidnapping him altogether. His bridle is missing, so that Simpson<br>must have put this on. Then, having left the door open behind<br>him, he was leading the horse away over the moor, when he was<br>either met or overtaken by the trainer. A row naturally ensued.<br>Simpson beat out the trainer’s brains with his heavy stick<br>without receiving any injury from the small knife which Straker<br>used in self-defence, and then the thief either led the horse on<br>to some secret hiding-place, or else it may have bolted during<br>the struggle, and be now wandering out on the moors. That is the<br>case as it appears to the police, and improbable as it is, all<br>other explanations are more improbable still. However, I shall<br>very quickly test the matter when I am once upon the spot, and<br>until then I cannot really see how we can get much further than<br>our present position.”<br></p>
<p>It was evening before we reached the little town of Tavistock,<br>which lies, like the boss of a shield, in the middle of the huge<br>circle of Dartmoor. Two gentlemen were awaiting us in the<br>station—the one a tall, fair man with lion-like hair and beard<br>and curiously penetrating light blue eyes; the other a small,<br>alert person, very neat and dapper, in a frock-coat and gaiters,<br>with trim little side-whiskers and an eye-glass. The latter was<br>Colonel Ross, the well-known sportsman; the other, Inspector<br>Gregory, a man who was rapidly making his name in the English<br>detective service.<br></p>
<p>“I am delighted that you have come down, Mr. Holmes,” said the<br>Colonel. “The Inspector here has done all that could possibly be<br>suggested, but I wish to leave no stone unturned in trying to<br>avenge poor Straker and in recovering my horse.”<br></p>
<p>“Have there been any fresh developments?” asked Holmes.<br></p>
<p>“I am sorry to say that we have made very little progress,” said<br>the Inspector. “We have an open carriage outside, and as you<br>would no doubt like to see the place before the light fails, we<br>might talk it over as we drive.”<br></p>
<p>A minute later we were all seated in a comfortable landau, and<br>were rattling through the quaint old Devonshire city. Inspector<br>Gregory was full of his case, and poured out a stream of remarks,<br>while Holmes threw in an occasional question or interjection.<br>Colonel Ross leaned back with his arms folded and his hat tilted<br>over his eyes, while I listened with interest to the dialogue of<br>the two detectives. Gregory was formulating his theory, which was<br>almost exactly what Holmes had foretold in the train.<br></p>
<p>“The net is drawn pretty close round Fitzroy Simpson,” he<br>remarked, “and I believe myself that he is our man. At the same<br>time I recognise that the evidence is purely circumstantial, and<br>that some new development may upset it.”<br></p>
<p>“How about Straker’s knife?”<br></p>
<p>“We have quite come to the conclusion that he wounded himself in<br>his fall.”<br></p>
<p>“My friend Dr. Watson made that suggestion to me as we came down.<br>If so, it would tell against this man Simpson.”<br></p>
<p>“Undoubtedly. He has neither a knife nor any sign of a wound. The<br>evidence against him is certainly very strong. He had a great<br>interest in the disappearance of the favourite. He lies under<br>suspicion of having poisoned the stable-boy, he was undoubtedly<br>out in the storm, he was armed with a heavy stick, and his cravat<br>was found in the dead man’s hand. I really think we have enough<br>to go before a jury.”<br></p>
<p>Holmes shook his head. “A clever counsel would tear it all to<br>rags,” said he. “Why should he take the horse out of the stable?<br>If he wished to injure it why could he not do it there? Has a<br>duplicate key been found in his possession? What chemist sold him<br>the powdered opium? Above all, where could he, a stranger to the<br>district, hide a horse, and such a horse as this? What is his own<br>explanation as to the paper which he wished the maid to give to<br>the stable-boy?”<br></p>
<p>“He says that it was a ten-pound note. One was found in his<br>purse. But your other difficulties are not so formidable as they<br>seem. He is not a stranger to the district. He has twice lodged<br>at Tavistock in the summer. The opium was probably brought from<br>London. The key, having served its purpose, would be hurled away.<br>The horse may be at the bottom of one of the pits or old mines<br>upon the moor.”<br></p>
<p>“What does he say about the cravat?”<br></p>
<p>“He acknowledges that it is his, and declares that he had lost<br>it. But a new element has been introduced into the case which may<br>account for his leading the horse from the stable.”<br></p>
<p>Holmes pricked up his ears.<br></p>
<p>“We have found traces which show that a party of gypsies encamped<br>on Monday night within a mile of the spot where the murder took<br>place. On Tuesday they were gone. Now, presuming that there was<br>some understanding between Simpson and these gypsies, might he<br>not have been leading the horse to them when he was overtaken,<br>and may they not have him now?”<br></p>
<p>“It is certainly possible.”<br></p>
<p>“The moor is being scoured for these gypsies. I have also<br>examined every stable and out-house in Tavistock, and for a<br>radius of ten miles.”<br></p>
<p>“There is another training-stable quite close, I understand?”<br></p>
<p>“Yes, and that is a factor which we must certainly not neglect.<br>As Desborough, their horse, was second in the betting, they had<br>an interest in the disappearance of the favourite. Silas Brown,<br>the trainer, is known to have had large bets upon the event, and<br>he was no friend to poor Straker. We have, however, examined the<br>stables, and there is nothing to connect him with the affair.”<br></p>
<p>“And nothing to connect this man Simpson with the interests of<br>the Mapleton stables?”<br></p>
<p>“Nothing at all.”<br></p>
<p>Holmes leaned back in the carriage, and the conversation ceased.<br>A few minutes later our driver pulled up at a neat little<br>red-brick villa with overhanging eaves which stood by the road.<br>Some distance off, across a paddock, lay a long grey-tiled<br>out-building. In every other direction the low curves of the<br>moor, bronze-coloured from the fading ferns, stretched away to<br>the sky-line, broken only by the steeples of Tavistock, and by a<br>cluster of houses away to the westward which marked the Mapleton<br>stables. We all sprang out with the exception of Holmes, who<br>continued to lean back with his eyes fixed upon the sky in front<br>of him, entirely absorbed in his own thoughts. It was only when I<br>touched his arm that he roused himself with a violent start and<br>stepped out of the carriage.<br></p>
<p>“Excuse me,” said he, turning to Colonel Ross, who had looked at<br>him in some surprise. “I was day-dreaming.” There was a gleam in<br>his eyes and a suppressed excitement in his manner which<br>convinced me, used as I was to his ways, that his hand was upon a<br>clue, though I could not imagine where he had found it.<br></p>
<p>“Perhaps you would prefer at once to go on to the scene of the<br>crime, Mr. Holmes?” said Gregory.<br></p>
<p>“I think that I should prefer to stay here a little and go into<br>one or two questions of detail. Straker was brought back here, I<br>presume?”<br></p>
<p>“Yes; he lies upstairs. The inquest is to-morrow.”<br></p>
<p>“He has been in your service some years, Colonel Ross?”<br></p>
<p>“I have always found him an excellent servant.”<br></p>
<p>“I presume that you made an inventory of what he had in his<br>pockets at the time of his death, Inspector?”<br></p>
<p>“I have the things themselves in the sitting-room, if you would<br>care to see them.”<br></p>
<p>“I should be very glad.” We all filed into the front room and sat<br>round the central table while the Inspector unlocked a square tin<br>box and laid a small heap of things before us. There was a box of<br>vestas, two inches of tallow candle, an A.D.P. briar-root pipe, a<br>pouch of seal-skin with half an ounce of long-cut Cavendish, a<br>silver watch with a gold chain, five sovereigns in gold, an<br>aluminium pencil-case, a few papers, and an ivory-handled knife<br>with a very delicate, inflexible blade marked Weiss & Co.,<br>London.<br></p>
<p>“This is a very singular knife,” said Holmes, lifting it up and<br>examining it minutely. “I presume, as I see blood-stains upon it,<br>that it is the one which was found in the dead man’s grasp.<br>Watson, this knife is surely in your line?”<br></p>
<p>“It is what we call a cataract knife,” said I.<br></p>
<p>“I thought so. A very delicate blade devised for very delicate<br>work. A strange thing for a man to carry with him upon a rough<br>expedition, especially as it would not shut in his pocket.”<br></p>
<p>“The tip was guarded by a disk of cork which we found beside his<br>body,” said the Inspector. “His wife tells us that the knife had<br>lain upon the dressing-table, and that he had picked it up as he<br>left the room. It was a poor weapon, but perhaps the best that he<br>could lay his hands on at the moment.”<br></p>
<p>“Very possible. How about these papers?”<br></p>
<p>“Three of them are receipted hay-dealers’ accounts. One of them<br>is a letter of instructions from Colonel Ross. This other is a<br>milliner’s account for thirty-seven pounds fifteen made out by<br>Madame Lesurier, of Bond Street, to William Derbyshire. Mrs.<br>Straker tells us that Derbyshire was a friend of her husband’s<br>and that occasionally his letters were addressed here.”<br></p>
<p>“Madam Derbyshire had somewhat expensive tastes,” remarked<br>Holmes, glancing down the account. “Twenty-two guineas is rather<br>heavy for a single costume. However there appears to be nothing<br>more to learn, and we may now go down to the scene of the crime.”<br></p>
<p>As we emerged from the sitting-room a woman, who had been waiting<br>in the passage, took a step forward and laid her hand upon the<br>Inspector’s sleeve. Her face was haggard and thin and eager,<br>stamped with the print of a recent horror.<br></p>
<p>“Have you got them? Have you found them?” she panted.<br></p>
<p>“No, Mrs. Straker. But Mr. Holmes here has come from London to<br>help us, and we shall do all that is possible.”<br></p>
<p>“Surely I met you in Plymouth at a garden-party some little time<br>ago, Mrs. Straker?” said Holmes.<br></p>
<p>“No, sir; you are mistaken.”<br></p>
<p>“Dear me! Why, I could have sworn to it. You wore a costume of<br>dove-coloured silk with ostrich-feather trimming.”<br></p>
<p>“I never had such a dress, sir,” answered the lady.<br></p>
<p>“Ah, that quite settles it,” said Holmes. And with an apology he<br>followed the Inspector outside. A short walk across the moor took<br>us to the hollow in which the body had been found. At the brink<br>of it was the furze-bush upon which the coat had been hung.<br></p>
<p>“There was no wind that night, I understand,” said Holmes.<br></p>
<p>“None; but very heavy rain.”<br></p>
<p>“In that case the overcoat was not blown against the furze-bush,<br>but placed there.”<br></p>
<p>“Yes, it was laid across the bush.”<br></p>
<p>“You fill me with interest, I perceive that the ground has been<br>trampled up a good deal. No doubt many feet have been here since<br>Monday night.”<br></p>
<p>“A piece of matting has been laid here at the side, and we have<br>all stood upon that.”<br></p>
<p>“Excellent.”<br></p>
<p>“In this bag I have one of the boots which Straker wore, one of<br>Fitzroy Simpson’s shoes, and a cast horseshoe of Silver Blaze.”<br></p>
<p>“My dear Inspector, you surpass yourself!” Holmes took the bag,<br>and, descending into the hollow, he pushed the matting into a<br>more central position. Then stretching himself upon his face and<br>leaning his chin upon his hands, he made a careful study of the<br>trampled mud in front of him. “Hullo!” said he, suddenly. “What’s<br>this?” It was a wax vesta half burned, which was so coated with<br>mud that it looked at first like a little chip of wood.<br></p>
<p>“I cannot think how I came to overlook it,” said the Inspector,<br>with an expression of annoyance.<br></p>
<p>“It was invisible, buried in the mud. I only saw it because I was<br>looking for it.”<br></p>
<p>“What! You expected to find it?”<br></p>
<p>“I thought it not unlikely.”<br></p>
<p>He took the boots from the bag, and compared the impressions of<br>each of them with marks upon the ground. Then he clambered up to<br>the rim of the hollow, and crawled about among the ferns and<br>bushes.<br></p>
<p>“I am afraid that there are no more tracks,” said the Inspector.<br>“I have examined the ground very carefully for a hundred yards in<br>each direction.”<br></p>
<p>“Indeed!” said Holmes, rising. “I should not have the<br>impertinence to do it again after what you say. But I should like<br>to take a little walk over the moor before it grows dark, that I<br>may know my ground to-morrow, and I think that I shall put this<br>horseshoe into my pocket for luck.”<br></p>
<p>Colonel Ross, who had shown some signs of impatience at my<br>companion’s quiet and systematic method of work, glanced at his<br>watch. “I wish you would come back with me, Inspector,” said he.<br>“There are several points on which I should like your advice, and<br>especially as to whether we do not owe it to the public to remove<br>our horse’s name from the entries for the Cup.”<br></p>
<p>“Certainly not,” cried Holmes, with decision. “I should let the<br>name stand.”<br></p>
<p>The Colonel bowed. “I am very glad to have had your opinion,<br>sir,” said he. “You will find us at poor Straker’s house when you<br>have finished your walk, and we can drive together into<br>Tavistock.”<br></p>
<p>He turned back with the Inspector, while Holmes and I walked<br>slowly across the moor. The sun was beginning to sink behind the<br>stables of Mapleton, and the long, sloping plain in front of us<br>was tinged with gold, deepening into rich, ruddy browns where the<br>faded ferns and brambles caught the evening light. But the<br>glories of the landscape were all wasted upon my companion, who<br>was sunk in the deepest thought.<br></p>
<p>“It’s this way, Watson,” said he at last. “We may leave the<br>question of who killed John Straker for the instant, and confine<br>ourselves to finding out what has become of the horse. Now,<br>supposing that he broke away during or after the tragedy, where<br>could he have gone to? The horse is a very gregarious creature.<br>If left to himself his instincts would have been either to return<br>to King’s Pyland or go over to Mapleton. Why should he run wild<br>upon the moor? He would surely have been seen by now. And why<br>should gypsies kidnap him? These people always clear out when<br>they hear of trouble, for they do not wish to be pestered by the<br>police. They could not hope to sell such a horse. They would run<br>a great risk and gain nothing by taking him. Surely that is<br>clear.”<br></p>
<p>“Where is he, then?”<br></p>
<p>“I have already said that he must have gone to King’s Pyland or<br>to Mapleton. He is not at King’s Pyland. Therefore he is at<br>Mapleton. Let us take that as a working hypothesis and see what<br>it leads us to. This part of the moor, as the Inspector remarked,<br>is very hard and dry. But it falls away towards Mapleton, and you<br>can see from here that there is a long hollow over yonder, which<br>must have been very wet on Monday night. If our supposition is<br>correct, then the horse must have crossed that, and there is the<br>point where we should look for his tracks.”<br></p>
<p>We had been walking briskly during this conversation, and a few<br>more minutes brought us to the hollow in question. At Holmes’<br>request I walked down the bank to the right, and he to the left,<br>but I had not taken fifty paces before I heard him give a shout,<br>and saw him waving his hand to me. The track of a horse was<br>plainly outlined in the soft earth in front of him, and the shoe<br>which he took from his pocket exactly fitted the impression.<br></p>
<p>“See the value of imagination,” said Holmes. “It is the one<br>quality which Gregory lacks. We imagined what might have<br>happened, acted upon the supposition, and find ourselves<br>justified. Let us proceed.”<br></p>
<p>We crossed the marshy bottom and passed over a quarter of a mile<br>of dry, hard turf. Again the ground sloped, and again we came on<br>the tracks. Then we lost them for half a mile, but only to pick<br>them up once more quite close to Mapleton. It was Holmes who saw<br>them first, and he stood pointing with a look of triumph upon his<br>face. A man’s track was visible beside the horse’s.<br></p>
<p>“The horse was alone before,” I cried.<br></p>
<p>“Quite so. It was alone before. Hullo, what is this?”<br></p>
<p>The double track turned sharp off and took the direction of<br>King’s Pyland. Holmes whistled, and we both followed along after<br>it. His eyes were on the trail, but I happened to look a little<br>to one side, and saw to my surprise the same tracks coming back<br>again in the opposite direction.<br></p>
<p>“One for you, Watson,” said Holmes, when I pointed it out. “You<br>have saved us a long walk, which would have brought us back on<br>our own traces. Let us follow the return track.”<br></p>
<p>We had not to go far. It ended at the paving of asphalt which led<br>up to the gates of the Mapleton stables. As we approached, a<br>groom ran out from them.<br></p>
<p>“We don’t want any loiterers about here,” said he.<br></p>
<p>“I only wished to ask a question,” said Holmes, with his finger<br>and thumb in his waistcoat pocket. “Should I be too early to see<br>your master, Mr. Silas Brown, if I were to call at five o’clock<br>to-morrow morning?”<br></p>
<p>“Bless you, sir, if any one is about he will be, for he is always<br>the first stirring. But here he is, sir, to answer your questions<br>for himself. No, sir, no; it is as much as my place is worth to<br>let him see me touch your money. Afterwards, if you like.”<br></p>
<p>As Sherlock Holmes replaced the half-crown which he had drawn<br>from his pocket, a fierce-looking elderly man strode out from the<br>gate with a hunting-crop swinging in his hand.<br></p>
<p>“What’s this, Dawson!” he cried. “No gossiping! Go about your<br>business! And you, what the devil do you want here?”<br></p>
<p>“Ten minutes’ talk with you, my good sir,” said Holmes in the<br>sweetest of voices.<br></p>
<p>“I’ve no time to talk to every gadabout. We want no strangers<br>here. Be off, or you may find a dog at your heels.”<br></p>
<p>Holmes leaned forward and whispered something in the trainer’s<br>ear. He started violently and flushed to the temples.<br></p>
<p>“It’s a lie!” he shouted, “an infernal lie!”<br></p>
<p>“Very good. Shall we argue about it here in public or talk it<br>over in your parlour?”<br></p>
<p>“Oh, come in if you wish to.”<br></p>
<p>Holmes smiled. “I shall not keep you more than a few minutes,<br>Watson,” said he. “Now, Mr. Brown, I am quite at your disposal.”<br></p>
<p>It was twenty minutes, and the reds had all faded into greys<br>before Holmes and the trainer reappeared. Never have I seen such<br>a change as had been brought about in Silas Brown in that short<br>time. His face was ashy pale, beads of perspiration shone upon<br>his brow, and his hands shook until the hunting-crop wagged like<br>a branch in the wind. His bullying, overbearing manner was all<br>gone too, and he cringed along at my companion’s side like a dog<br>with its master.<br></p>
<p>“Your instructions will be done. It shall all be done,” said he.<br></p>
<p>“There must be no mistake,” said Holmes, looking round at him.<br>The other winced as he read the menace in his eyes.<br></p>
<p>“Oh no, there shall be no mistake. It shall be there. Should I<br>change it first or not?”<br></p>
<p>Holmes thought a little and then burst out laughing. “No, don’t,”<br>said he; “I shall write to you about it. No tricks, now, or—”<br></p>
<p>“Oh, you can trust me, you can trust me!”<br></p>
<p>“Yes, I think I can. Well, you shall hear from me to-morrow.” He<br>turned upon his heel, disregarding the trembling hand which the<br>other held out to him, and we set off for King’s Pyland.<br></p>
<p>“A more perfect compound of the bully, coward, and sneak than<br>Master Silas Brown I have seldom met with,” remarked Holmes as we<br>trudged along together.<br></p>
<p>“He has the horse, then?”<br></p>
<p>“He tried to bluster out of it, but I described to him so exactly<br>what his actions had been upon that morning that he is convinced<br>that I was watching him. Of course you observed the peculiarly<br>square toes in the impressions, and that his own boots exactly<br>corresponded to them. Again, of course no subordinate would have<br>dared to do such a thing. I described to him how, when according<br>to his custom he was the first down, he perceived a strange horse<br>wandering over the moor. How he went out to it, and his<br>astonishment at recognising, from the white forehead which has<br>given the favourite its name, that chance had put in his power<br>the only horse which could beat the one upon which he had put his<br>money. Then I described how his first impulse had been to lead<br>him back to King’s Pyland, and how the devil had shown him how he<br>could hide the horse until the race was over, and how he had led<br>it back and concealed it at Mapleton. When I told him every<br>detail he gave it up and thought only of saving his own skin.”<br></p>
<p>“But his stables had been searched?”<br></p>
<p>“Oh, an old horse-faker like him has many a dodge.”<br></p>
<p>“But are you not afraid to leave the horse in his power now,<br>since he has every interest in injuring it?”<br></p>
<p>“My dear fellow, he will guard it as the apple of his eye. He<br>knows that his only hope of mercy is to produce it safe.”<br></p>
<p>“Colonel Ross did not impress me as a man who would be likely to<br>show much mercy in any case.”<br></p>
<p>“The matter does not rest with Colonel Ross. I follow my own<br>methods, and tell as much or as little as I choose. That is the<br>advantage of being unofficial. I don’t know whether you observed<br>it, Watson, but the Colonel’s manner has been just a trifle<br>cavalier to me. I am inclined now to have a little amusement at<br>his expense. Say nothing to him about the horse.”<br></p>
<p>“Certainly not without your permission.”<br></p>
<p>“And of course this is all quite a minor point compared to the<br>question of who killed John Straker.”<br></p>
<p>“And you will devote yourself to that?”<br></p>
<p>“On the contrary, we both go back to London by the night train.”<br></p>
<p>I was thunderstruck by my friend’s words. We had only been a few<br>hours in Devonshire, and that he should give up an investigation<br>which he had begun so brilliantly was quite incomprehensible to<br>me. Not a word more could I draw from him until we were back at<br>the trainer’s house. The Colonel and the Inspector were awaiting<br>us in the parlour.<br></p>
<p>“My friend and I return to town by the night-express,” said<br>Holmes. “We have had a charming little breath of your beautiful<br>Dartmoor air.”<br></p>
<p>The Inspector opened his eyes, and the Colonel’s lip curled in a<br>sneer.<br></p>
<p>“So you despair of arresting the murderer of poor Straker,” said<br>he.<br></p>
<p>Holmes shrugged his shoulders. “There are certainly grave<br>difficulties in the way,” said he. “I have every hope, however,<br>that your horse will start upon Tuesday, and I beg that you will<br>have your jockey in readiness. Might I ask for a photograph of<br>Mr. John Straker?”<br></p>
<p>The Inspector took one from an envelope and handed it to him.<br></p>
<p>“My dear Gregory, you anticipate all my wants. If I might ask you<br>to wait here for an instant, I have a question which I should<br>like to put to the maid.”<br></p>
<p>“I must say that I am rather disappointed in our London<br>consultant,” said Colonel Ross, bluntly, as my friend left the<br>room. “I do not see that we are any further than when he came.”<br></p>
<p>“At least you have his assurance that your horse will run,” said<br>I.<br></p>
<p>“Yes, I have his assurance,” said the Colonel, with a shrug of<br>his shoulders. “I should prefer to have the horse.”<br></p>
<p>I was about to make some reply in defence of my friend when he<br>entered the room again.<br></p>
<p>“Now, gentlemen,” said he, “I am quite ready for Tavistock.”<br></p>
<p>As we stepped into the carriage one of the stable-lads held the<br>door open for us. A sudden idea seemed to occur to Holmes, for he<br>leaned forward and touched the lad upon the sleeve.<br></p>
<p>“You have a few sheep in the paddock,” he said. “Who attends to<br>them?”<br></p>
<p>“I do, sir.”<br></p>
<p>“Have you noticed anything amiss with them of late?”<br></p>
<p>“Well, sir, not of much account; but three of them have gone<br>lame, sir.”<br></p>
<p>I could see that Holmes was extremely pleased, for he chuckled<br>and rubbed his hands together.<br></p>
<p>“A long shot, Watson; a very long shot,” said he, pinching my<br>arm. “Gregory, let me recommend to your attention this singular<br>epidemic among the sheep. Drive on, coachman!”<br></p>
<p>Colonel Ross still wore an expression which showed the poor<br>opinion which he had formed of my companion’s ability, but I saw<br>by the Inspector’s face that his attention had been keenly<br>aroused.<br></p>
<p>“You consider that to be important?” he asked.<br></p>
<p>“Exceedingly so.”<br></p>
<p>“Is there any point to which you would wish to draw my<br>attention?”<br></p>
<p>“To the curious incident of the dog in the night-time.”<br></p>
<p>“The dog did nothing in the night-time.”<br></p>
<p>“That was the curious incident,” remarked Sherlock Holmes.<br></p>
<p>Four days later Holmes and I were again in the train, bound for<br>Winchester to see the race for the Wessex Cup. Colonel Ross met<br>us by appointment outside the station, and we drove in his drag<br>to the course beyond the town. His face was grave, and his manner<br>was cold in the extreme.<br></p>
<p>“I have seen nothing of my horse,” said he.<br></p>
<p>“I suppose that you would know him when you saw him?” asked<br>Holmes.<br></p>
<p>The Colonel was very angry. “I have been on the turf for twenty<br>years, and never was asked such a question as that before,” said<br>he. “A child would know Silver Blaze, with his white forehead and<br>his mottled off-foreleg.”<br></p>
<p>“How is the betting?”<br></p>
<p>“Well, that is the curious part of it. You could have got fifteen<br>to one yesterday, but the price has become shorter and shorter,<br>until you can hardly get three to one now.”<br></p>
<p>“Hum!” said Holmes. “Somebody knows something, that is clear.”<br></p>
<p>As the drag drew up in the enclosure near the grand stand I<br>glanced at the card to see the entries. It ran:—<br></p>
<p>Wessex Plate. 50 sovs each h ft with 1000 sovs added for four and<br>five year olds. Second, £300. Third, £200. New course (one mile<br>and five furlongs).<br>1. Mr. Heath Newton’s The Negro (red cap, cinnamon jacket).<br>2. Colonel Wardlaw’s Pugilist (pink cap, blue and black jacket).<br>3. Lord Backwater’s Desborough (yellow cap and sleeves).<br>4. Colonel Ross’s Silver Blaze (black cap, red jacket).<br>5. Duke of Balmoral’s Iris (yellow and black stripes).<br>6. Lord Singleford’s Rasper (purple cap, black sleeves).<br></p>
<p>“We scratched our other one, and put all hopes on your word,”<br>said the Colonel. “Why, what is that? Silver Blaze favourite?”<br></p>
<p>“Five to four against Silver Blaze!” roared the ring. “Five to<br>four against Silver Blaze! Five to fifteen against Desborough!<br>Five to four on the field!”<br></p>
<p>“There are the numbers up,” I cried. “They are all six there.”<br></p>
<p>“All six there? Then my horse is running,” cried the Colonel in<br>great agitation. “But I don’t see him. My colours have not<br>passed.”<br></p>
<p>“Only five have passed. This must be he.”<br></p>
<p>As I spoke a powerful bay horse swept out from the weighing<br>enclosure and cantered past us, bearing on its back the<br>well-known black and red of the Colonel.<br></p>
<p>“That’s not my horse,” cried the owner. “That beast has not a<br>white hair upon its body. What is this that you have done, Mr.<br>Holmes?”<br></p>
<p>“Well, well, let us see how he gets on,” said my friend,<br>imperturbably. For a few minutes he gazed through my field-glass.<br>“Capital! An excellent start!” he cried suddenly. “There they<br>are, coming round the curve!”<br></p>
<p>From our drag we had a superb view as they came up the straight.<br>The six horses were so close together that a carpet could have<br>covered them, but half way up the yellow of the Mapleton stable<br>showed to the front. Before they reached us, however,<br>Desborough’s bolt was shot, and the Colonel’s horse, coming away<br>with a rush, passed the post a good six lengths before its rival,<br>the Duke of Balmoral’s Iris making a bad third.<br></p>
<p>“It’s my race, anyhow,” gasped the Colonel, passing his hand over<br>his eyes. “I confess that I can make neither head nor tail of it.<br>Don’t you think that you have kept up your mystery long enough,<br>Mr. Holmes?”<br></p>
<p>“Certainly, Colonel, you shall know everything. Let us all go<br>round and have a look at the horse together. Here he is,” he<br>continued, as we made our way into the weighing enclosure, where<br>only owners and their friends find admittance. “You have only to<br>wash his face and his leg in spirits of wine, and you will find<br>that he is the same old Silver Blaze as ever.”<br></p>
<p>“You take my breath away!”<br></p>
<p>“I found him in the hands of a faker, and took the liberty of<br>running him just as he was sent over.”<br></p>
<p>“My dear sir, you have done wonders. The horse looks very fit and<br>well. It never went better in its life. I owe you a thousand<br>apologies for having doubted your ability. You have done me a<br>great service by recovering my horse. You would do me a greater<br>still if you could lay your hands on the murderer of John<br>Straker.”<br></p>
<p>“I have done so,” said Holmes quietly.<br></p>
<p>The Colonel and I stared at him in amazement. “You have got him!<br>Where is he, then?”<br></p>
<p>“He is here.”<br></p>
<p>“Here! Where?”<br></p>
<p>“In my company at the present moment.”<br></p>
<p>The Colonel flushed angrily. “I quite recognise that I am under<br>obligations to you, Mr. Holmes,” said he, “but I must regard what<br>you have just said as either a very bad joke or an insult.”<br></p>
<p>Sherlock Holmes laughed. “I assure you that I have not associated<br>you with the crime, Colonel,” said he. “The real murderer is<br>standing immediately behind you.” He stepped past and laid his<br>hand upon the glossy neck of the thoroughbred.<br></p>
<p>“The horse!” cried both the Colonel and myself.<br></p>
<p>“Yes, the horse. And it may lessen his guilt if I say that it was<br>done in self-defence, and that John Straker was a man who was<br>entirely unworthy of your confidence. But there goes the bell,<br>and as I stand to win a little on this next race, I shall defer a<br>lengthy explanation until a more fitting time.”<br></p>
<p>We had the corner of a Pullman car to ourselves that evening as<br>we whirled back to London, and I fancy that the journey was a<br>short one to Colonel Ross as well as to myself, as we listened to<br>our companion’s narrative of the events which had occurred at the<br>Dartmoor training-stables upon the Monday night, and the means by<br>which he had unravelled them.<br></p>
<p>“I confess,” said he, “that any theories which I had formed from<br>the newspaper reports were entirely erroneous. And yet there were<br>indications there, had they not been overlaid by other details<br>which concealed their true import. I went to Devonshire with the<br>conviction that Fitzroy Simpson was the true culprit, although,<br>of course, I saw that the evidence against him was by no means<br>complete. It was while I was in the carriage, just as we reached<br>the trainer’s house, that the immense significance of the curried<br>mutton occurred to me. You may remember that I was distrait, and<br>remained sitting after you had all alighted. I was marvelling in<br>my own mind how I could possibly have overlooked so obvious a<br>clue.”<br></p>
<p>“I confess,” said the Colonel, “that even now I cannot see how it<br>helps us.”<br></p>
<p>“It was the first link in my chain of reasoning. Powdered opium<br>is by no means tasteless. The flavour is not disagreeable, but it<br>is perceptible. Were it mixed with any ordinary dish the eater<br>would undoubtedly detect it, and would probably eat no more. A<br>curry was exactly the medium which would disguise this taste. By<br>no possible supposition could this stranger, Fitzroy Simpson,<br>have caused curry to be served in the trainer’s family that<br>night, and it is surely too monstrous a coincidence to suppose<br>that he happened to come along with powdered opium upon the very<br>night when a dish happened to be served which would disguise the<br>flavour. That is unthinkable. Therefore Simpson becomes<br>eliminated from the case, and our attention centres upon Straker<br>and his wife, the only two people who could have chosen curried<br>mutton for supper that night. The opium was added after the dish<br>was set aside for the stable-boy, for the others had the same for<br>supper with no ill effects. Which of them, then, had access to<br>that dish without the maid seeing them?<br></p>
<p>“Before deciding that question I had grasped the significance of<br>the silence of the dog, for one true inference invariably<br>suggests others. The Simpson incident had shown me that a dog was<br>kept in the stables, and yet, though some one had been in and had<br>fetched out a horse, he had not barked enough to arouse the two<br>lads in the loft. Obviously the midnight visitor was some one<br>whom the dog knew well.<br></p>
<p>“I was already convinced, or almost convinced, that John Straker<br>went down to the stables in the dead of the night and took out<br>Silver Blaze. For what purpose? For a dishonest one, obviously,<br>or why should he drug his own stable-boy? And yet I was at a loss<br>to know why. There have been cases before now where trainers have<br>made sure of great sums of money by laying against their own<br>horses, through agents, and then preventing them from winning by<br>fraud. Sometimes it is a pulling jockey. Sometimes it is some<br>surer and subtler means. What was it here? I hoped that the<br>contents of his pockets might help me to form a conclusion.<br></p>
<p>“And they did so. You cannot have forgotten the singular knife<br>which was found in the dead man’s hand, a knife which certainly<br>no sane man would choose for a weapon. It was, as Dr. Watson told<br>us, a form of knife which is used for the most delicate<br>operations known in surgery. And it was to be used for a delicate<br>operation that night. You must know, with your wide experience of<br>turf matters, Colonel Ross, that it is possible to make a slight<br>nick upon the tendons of a horse’s ham, and to do it<br>subcutaneously, so as to leave absolutely no trace. A horse so<br>treated would develop a slight lameness, which would be put down<br>to a strain in exercise or a touch of rheumatism, but never to<br>foul play.”<br></p>
<p>“Villain! Scoundrel!” cried the Colonel.<br></p>
<p>“We have here the explanation of why John Straker wished to take<br>the horse out on to the moor. So spirited a creature would have<br>certainly roused the soundest of sleepers when it felt the prick<br>of the knife. It was absolutely necessary to do it in the open<br>air.”<br></p>
<p>“I have been blind!” cried the Colonel. “Of course that was why<br>he needed the candle, and struck the match.”<br></p>
<p>“Undoubtedly. But in examining his belongings I was fortunate<br>enough to discover not only the method of the crime, but even its<br>motives. As a man of the world, Colonel, you know that men do not<br>carry other people’s bills about in their pockets. We have most<br>of us quite enough to do to settle our own. I at once concluded<br>that Straker was leading a double life, and keeping a second<br>establishment. The nature of the bill showed that there was a<br>lady in the case, and one who had expensive tastes. Liberal as<br>you are with your servants, one can hardly expect that they can<br>buy twenty-guinea walking dresses for their ladies. I questioned<br>Mrs. Straker as to the dress without her knowing it, and having<br>satisfied myself that it had never reached her, I made a note of<br>the milliner’s address, and felt that by calling there with<br>Straker’s photograph I could easily dispose of the mythical<br>Derbyshire.<br></p>
<p>“From that time on all was plain. Straker had led out the horse<br>to a hollow where his light would be invisible. Simpson in his<br>flight had dropped his cravat, and Straker had picked it up—with<br>some idea, perhaps, that he might use it in securing the horse’s<br>leg. Once in the hollow, he had got behind the horse and had<br>struck a light; but the creature frightened at the sudden glare,<br>and with the strange instinct of animals feeling that some<br>mischief was intended, had lashed out, and the steel shoe had<br>struck Straker full on the forehead. He had already, in spite of<br>the rain, taken off his overcoat in order to do his delicate<br>task, and so, as he fell, his knife gashed his thigh. Do I make<br>it clear?”<br></p>
<p>“Wonderful!” cried the Colonel. “Wonderful! You might have been<br>there!”<br></p>
<p>“My final shot was, I confess a very long one. It struck me that<br>so astute a man as Straker would not undertake this delicate<br>tendon-nicking without a little practice. What could he practice<br>on? My eyes fell upon the sheep, and I asked a question which,<br>rather to my surprise, showed that my surmise was correct.<br></p>
<p>“When I returned to London I called upon the milliner, who had<br>recognised Straker as an excellent customer of the name of<br>Derbyshire, who had a very dashing wife, with a strong partiality<br>for expensive dresses. I have no doubt that this woman had<br>plunged him over head and ears in debt, and so led him into this<br>miserable plot.”<br></p>
<p>“You have explained all but one thing,” cried the Colonel. “Where<br>was the horse?”<br></p>
<p>“Ah, it bolted, and was cared for by one of your neighbours. We<br>must have an amnesty in that direction, I think. This is Clapham<br>Junction, if I am not mistaken, and we shall be in Victoria in<br>less than ten minutes. If you care to smoke a cigar in our rooms,<br>Colonel, I shall be happy to give you any other details which<br>might interest you.”<br></p>
