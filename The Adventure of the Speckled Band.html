        <h1>THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND</h1>
        <p>On glancing over my notes of the seventy odd cases in which I have<br>during the last eight years studied the methods of my friend Sherlock<br>Holmes, I find many tragic, some comic, a large number merely strange,<br>but none commonplace; for, working as he did rather for the love of his<br>art than for the acquirement of wealth, he refused to associate himself<br>with any investigation which did not tend towards the unusual, and even<br>the fantastic. Of all these varied cases, however, I cannot recall any<br>which presented more singular features than that which was associated<br>with the well-known Surrey family of the Roylotts of Stoke Moran. The<br>events in question occurred in the early days of my association with<br>Holmes, when we were sharing rooms as bachelors in Baker Street. It<br>is possible that I might have placed them upon record before, but a<br>promise of secrecy was made at the time, from which I have only been<br>freed during the last month by the untimely death of the lady to whom<br>the pledge was given. It is perhaps as well that the facts should now<br>come to light, for I have reasons to know that there are wide-spread<br>rumors as to the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott which tend to make the<br>matter even more terrible than the truth.<br></p>
<p>It was early in April in the year ’83 that I woke one morning to find<br>Sherlock Holmes standing, fully dressed, by the side of my bed. He was<br>a late riser as a rule, and as the clock on the mantel-piece showed<br>me that it was only a quarter past seven, I blinked up at him in some<br>surprise, and perhaps just a little resentment, for I was myself<br>regular in my habits.<br></p>
<p>“Very sorry to knock you up, Watson,” said he, “but it’s the common lot<br>this morning. Mrs. Hudson has been knocked up, she retorted upon me,<br>and I on you.”<br></p>
<p>“What is it, then—a fire?”<br></p>
<p>“No; a client. It seems that a young lady has arrived in a considerable<br>state of excitement, who insists upon seeing me. She is waiting now in<br>the sitting-room. Now, when young ladies wander about the metropolis<br>at this hour of the morning, and knock sleepy people up out of their<br>beds, I presume that it is something very pressing which they have to<br>communicate. Should it prove to be an interesting case, you would, I am<br>sure, wish to follow it from the outset. I thought, at any rate, that I<br>should call you and give you the chance.”<br></p>
<p>“My dear fellow, I would not miss it for anything.”<br></p>
<p>I had no keener pleasure than in following Holmes in his professional<br>investigations, and in admiring the rapid deductions, as swift as<br>intuitions, and yet always founded on a logical basis, with which he<br>unravelled the problems which were submitted to him. I rapidly threw on<br>my clothes, and was ready in a few minutes to accompany my friend down<br>to the sitting-room. A lady dressed in black and heavily veiled, who<br>had been sitting in the window, rose as we entered.<br></p>
<p>“Good-morning, madam,” said Holmes, cheerily. “My name is Sherlock<br>Holmes. This is my intimate friend and associate, Dr. Watson, before<br>whom you can speak as freely as before myself. Ha! I am glad to see<br>that Mrs. Hudson has had the good sense to light the fire. Pray draw up<br>to it, and I shall order you a cup of hot coffee, for I observe that<br>you are shivering.”<br></p>
<p>“It is not cold which makes me shiver,” said the woman, in a low voice,<br>changing her seat as requested.<br></p>
<p>“What, then?”<br></p>
<p>“It is fear, Mr. Holmes. It is terror.” She raised her veil as she<br>spoke, and we could see that she was indeed in a pitiable state of<br>agitation, her face all drawn and gray, with restless, frightened eyes,<br>like those of some hunted animal. Her features and figure were those of<br>a woman of thirty, but her hair was shot with premature gray, and her<br>expression was weary and haggard. Sherlock Holmes ran her over with one<br>of his quick, all-comprehensive glances.<br></p>
<p>“You must not fear,” said he, soothingly, bending forward and patting<br>her forearm. “We shall soon set matters right, I have no doubt. You<br>have come in by train this morning, I see.”<br></p>
<p>“You know me, then?”<br></p>
<p>“No, but I observe the second half of a return ticket in the palm of<br>your left glove. You must have started early, and yet you had a good<br>drive in a dog-cart, along heavy roads, before you reached the station.”<br></p>
<p>The lady gave a violent start, and stared in bewilderment at my<br>companion.<br></p>
<p>“There is no mystery, my dear madam,” said he, smiling. “The left arm<br>of your jacket is spattered with mud in no less than seven places. The<br>marks are perfectly fresh. There is no vehicle save a dog-cart which<br>throws up mud in that way, and then only when you sit on the left-hand<br>side of the driver.”<br></p>
<p>“Whatever your reasons may be, you are perfectly correct,” said she. “I<br>started from home before six, reached Leatherhead at twenty past, and<br>came in by the first train to Waterloo. Sir, I can stand this strain no<br>longer; I shall go mad if it continues. I have no one to turn to—none,<br>save only one, who cares for me, and he, poor fellow, can be of little<br>aid. I have heard of you, Mr. Holmes; I have heard of you from Mrs.<br>Farintosh, whom you helped in the hour of her sore need. It was from<br>her that I had your address. Oh, sir, do you not think that you could<br>help me, too, and at least throw a little light through the dense<br>darkness which surrounds me? At present it is out of my power to reward<br>you for your services, but in a month or six weeks I shall be married,<br>with the control of my own income, and then at least you shall not<br>find me ungrateful.”<br></p>
<p>Holmes turned to his desk, and unlocking it, drew out a small<br>case-book, which he consulted.<br></p>
<p>“Farintosh,” said he. “Ah yes, I recall the case; it was concerned with<br>an opal tiara. I think it was before your time, Watson. I can only say,<br>madam, that I shall be happy to devote the same care to your case as<br>I did to that of your friend. As to reward, my profession is its own<br>reward; but you are at liberty to defray whatever expenses I may be put<br>to, at the time which suits you best. And now I beg that you will lay<br>before us everything that may help us in forming an opinion upon the<br>matter.”<br></p>
<p>“Alas!” replied our visitor, “the very horror of my situation lies<br>in the fact that my fears are so vague, and my suspicions depend so<br>entirely upon small points, which might seem trivial to another, that<br>even he to whom of all others I have a right to look for help and<br>advice looks upon all that I tell him about it as the fancies of a<br>nervous woman. He does not say so, but I can read it from his soothing<br>answers and averted eyes. But I have heard, Mr. Holmes, that you can<br>see deeply into the manifold wickedness of the human heart. You may<br>advise me how to walk amid the dangers which encompass me.”<br></p>
<p>“I am all attention, madam.”<br></p>
<p>“My name is Helen Stoner, and I am living with my step-father, who is<br>the last survivor of one of the oldest Saxon families in England, the<br>Roylotts of Stoke Moran, on the western border of Surrey.”<br></p>
<p>Holmes nodded his head. “The name is familiar to me,” said he.<br></p>
<p>“The family was at one time among the richest in England, and the<br>estates extended over the borders into Berkshire in the north, and<br>Hampshire in the west. In the last century, however, four successive<br>heirs were of a dissolute and wasteful disposition, and the family<br>ruin was eventually completed by a gambler in the days of the<br>Regency. Nothing was left save a few acres of ground, and the<br>two-hundred-year-old house, which is itself crushed under a heavy<br>mortgage. The last squire dragged out his existence there, living<br>the horrible life of an aristocratic pauper; but his only son, my<br>step-father, seeing that he must adapt himself to the new conditions,<br>obtained an advance from a relative, which enabled him to take a<br>medical degree, and went out to Calcutta, where, by his professional<br>skill and his force of character, he established a large practice.<br>In a fit of anger, however, caused by some robberies which had been<br>perpetrated in the house, he beat his native butler to death, and<br>narrowly escaped a capital sentence. As it was, he suffered a long<br>term of imprisonment, and afterwards returned to England a morose and<br>disappointed man.<br></p>
<p>“When Dr. Roylott was in India he married my mother, Mrs. Stoner, the<br>young widow of Major-general Stoner, of the Bengal Artillery. My sister<br>Julia and I were twins, and we were only two years old at the time of<br>my mother’s re-marriage. She had a considerable sum of money—not less<br>than £1000 a year—and this she bequeathed to Dr. Roylott entirely<br>while we resided with him, with a provision that a certain annual sum<br>should be allowed to each of us in the event of our marriage. Shortly<br>after our return to England my mother died—she was killed eight years<br>ago in a railway accident near Crewe. Dr. Roylott then abandoned his<br>attempts to establish himself in practice in London, and took us to<br>live with him in the old ancestral house at Stoke Moran. The money<br>which my mother had left was enough for all our wants, and there seemed<br>to be no obstacle to our happiness.<br></p>
<p>“But a terrible change came over our step-father about this time.<br>Instead of making friends and exchanging visits with our neighbors, who<br>had at first been overjoyed to see a Roylott of Stoke Moran back in<br>the old family seat, he shut himself up in his house, and seldom came<br>out save to indulge in ferocious quarrels with whoever might cross his<br>path. Violence of temper approaching to mania has been hereditary in<br>the men of the family, and in my step-father’s case it had, I believe,<br>been intensified by his long residence in the tropics. A series of<br>disgraceful brawls took place, two of which ended in the police-court,<br>until at last he became the terror of the village, and the folks<br>would fly at his approach, for he is a man of immense strength, and<br>absolutely uncontrollable in his anger.<br></p>
<p>“Last week he hurled the local blacksmith over a parapet into a stream,<br>and it was only by paying over all the money which I could gather<br>together that I was able to avert another public exposure. He had no<br>friends at all save the wandering gypsies, and he would give these<br>vagabonds leave to encamp upon the few acres of bramble-covered land<br>which represent the family estate, and would accept in return the<br>hospitality of their tents, wandering away with them sometimes for<br>weeks on end. He has a passion also for Indian animals, which are sent<br>over to him by a correspondent, and he has at this moment a cheetah and<br>a baboon, which wander freely over his grounds, and are feared by the<br>villagers almost as much as their master.<br></p>
<p>“You can imagine from what I say that my poor sister Julia and I had no<br>great pleasure in our lives. No servant would stay with us, and for a<br>long time we did all the work of the house. She was but thirty at the<br>time of her death, and yet her hair had already begun to whiten, even<br>as mine has.”<br></p>
<p>“Your sister is dead, then?”<br></p>
<p>“She died just two years ago, and it is of her death that I wish to<br>speak to you. You can understand that, living the life which I have<br>described, we were little likely to see anyone of our own age and<br>position. We had, however, an aunt, my mother’s maiden sister, Miss<br>Honoria Westphail, who lives near Harrow, and we were occasionally<br>allowed to pay short visits at this lady’s house. Julia went there at<br>Christmas two years ago, and met there a half-pay major of marines,<br>to whom she became engaged. My step-father learned of the engagement<br>when my sister returned, and offered no objection to the marriage; but<br>within a fortnight of the day which had been fixed for the wedding, the<br>terrible event occurred which has deprived me of my only companion.”<br></p>
<p>Sherlock Holmes had been leaning back in his chair with his eyes closed<br>and his head sunk in a cushion, but he half opened his lids now and<br>glanced across at his visitor.<br></p>
<p>“Pray be precise as to details,” said he.<br></p>
<p>“It is easy for me to be so, for every event of that dreadful time is<br>seared into my memory. The manor-house is, as I have already said, very<br>old, and only one wing is now inhabited. The bedrooms in this wing are<br>on the ground floor, the sitting-rooms being in the central block of<br>the buildings. Of these bedrooms the first is Dr. Roylott’s, the second<br>my sister’s, and the third my own. There is no communication between<br>them, but they all open out into the same corridor. Do I make myself<br>plain?”<br></p>
<p>“Perfectly so.”<br></p>
<p>“The windows of the three rooms open out upon the lawn. That fatal<br>night Dr. Roylott had gone to his room early, though we knew that he<br>had not retired to rest, for my sister was troubled by the smell of<br>the strong Indian cigars which it was his custom to smoke. She left<br>her room, therefore, and came into mine, where she sat for some time,<br>chatting about her approaching wedding. At eleven o’clock she rose to<br>leave me but she paused at the door and looked back.<br></p>
<p>“‘Tell me, Helen,’ said she, ‘have you ever heard any one whistle in<br>the dead of the night?’<br></p>
<p>“‘Never,’ said I.<br></p>
<p>“‘I suppose that you could not possibly whistle, yourself, in your<br>sleep?’<br></p>
<p>“‘Certainly not. But why?’<br></p>
<p>“‘Because during the last few nights I have always, about three in<br>the morning, heard a low, clear whistle. I am a light sleeper, and it<br>has awakened me. I cannot tell where it came from—perhaps from the<br>next room, perhaps from the lawn. I thought that I would just ask you<br>whether you had heard it.’<br></p>
<p>“‘No, I have not. It must be those wretched gypsies in the plantation.’<br></p>
<p>“‘Very likely. And yet if it were on the lawn, I wonder that you did<br>not hear it also.’<br></p>
<p>“‘Ah, but I sleep more heavily than you.’<br></p>
<p>“‘Well, it is of no great consequence, at any rate.’ She smiled back at<br>me, closed my door, and a few moments later I heard her key turn in the<br>lock.”<br></p>
<p>“Indeed,” said Holmes. “Was it your custom always to lock yourselves in<br>at night?”<br></p>
<p>“Always.”<br></p>
<p>“And why?”<br></p>
<p>“I think that I mentioned to you that the doctor kept a cheetah and a<br>baboon. We had no feeling of security unless our doors were locked.”<br></p>
<p>“Quite so. Pray proceed with your statement.”<br></p>
<p>“I could not sleep that night. A vague feeling of impending misfortune<br>impressed me. My sister and I, you will recollect, were twins, and you<br>know how subtle are the links which bind two souls which are so closely<br>allied. It was a wild night. The wind was howling outside, and the rain<br>was beating and splashing against the windows. Suddenly, amid all the<br>hubbub of the gale, there burst forth the wild scream of a terrified<br>woman. I knew that it was my sister’s voice. I sprang from my bed,<br>wrapped a shawl round me, and rushed into the corridor. As I opened my<br>door I seemed to hear a low whistle, such as my sister described, and a<br>few moments later a clanging sound, as if a mass of metal had fallen.<br>As I ran down the passage, my sister’s door was unlocked, and revolved<br>slowly upon its hinges. I stared at it horror-stricken, not knowing<br>what was about to issue from it. By the light of the corridor-lamp I<br>saw my sister appear at the opening, her face blanched with terror, her<br>hands groping for help, her whole figure swaying to and fro like that<br>of a drunkard. I ran to her and threw my arms round her, but at that<br>moment her knees seemed to give way and she fell to the ground. She<br>writhed as one who is in terrible pain, and her limbs were dreadfully<br>convulsed. At first I thought that she had not recognized me, but as I<br>bent over her she suddenly shrieked out in a voice which I shall never<br>forget, ‘Oh, my God! Helen! It was the band! The speckled band!’ There<br>was something else which she would fain have said, and she stabbed with<br>her finger into the air in the direction of the doctor’s room, but a<br>fresh convulsion seized her and choked her words. I rushed out, calling<br>loudly for my step-father, and I met him hastening from his room in his<br>dressing-gown. When he reached my sister’s side she was unconscious,<br>and though he poured brandy down her throat and sent for medical aid<br>from the village, all efforts were in vain, for she slowly sank and<br>died without having recovered her consciousness. Such was the dreadful<br>end of my beloved sister.”<br></p>
<p>“One moment,” said Holmes; “are you sure about this whistle and<br>metallic sound? Could you swear to it?”<br></p>
<p>“That was what the county coroner asked me at the inquiry. It is my<br>strong impression that I heard it, and yet, among the crash of the gale<br>and the creaking of an old house, I may possibly have been deceived.”<br></p>
<p>“Was your sister dressed?”<br></p>
<p>“No, she was in her night-dress. In her right hand was found the<br>charred stump of a match, and in her left a matchbox.”<br></p>
<p>“Showing that she had struck a light and looked about her when the<br>alarm took place. That is important. And what conclusions did the<br>coroner come to?”<br></p>
<p>“He investigated the case with great care, for Dr. Roylott’s conduct<br>had long been notorious in the county, but he was unable to find any<br>satisfactory cause of death. My evidence showed that the door had<br>been fastened upon the inner side, and the windows were blocked by<br>old-fashioned shutters with broad iron bars, which were secured every<br>night. The walls were carefully sounded, and were shown to be quite<br>solid all round, and the flooring was also thoroughly examined, with<br>the same result. The chimney is wide, but is barred up by four large<br>staples. It is certain, therefore, that my sister was quite alone when<br>she met her end. Besides, there were no marks of any violence upon her.”<br></p>
<p>“How about poison?”<br></p>
<p>“The doctors examined her for it, but without success.”<br></p>
<p>“What do you think that this unfortunate lady died of, then?”<br></p>
<p>“It is my belief that she died of pure fear and nervous shock, though<br>what it was that frightened her I cannot imagine.”<br></p>
<p>“Were there gypsies in the plantation at the time?”<br></p>
<p>“Yes, there are nearly always some there.”<br></p>
<p>“Ah, and what did you gather from this allusion to a band—a speckled<br>band?”<br></p>
<p>“Sometimes I have thought that it was merely the wild talk of delirium,<br>sometimes that it may have referred to some band of people, perhaps to<br>these very gypsies in the plantation. I do not know whether the spotted<br>handkerchiefs which so many of them wear over their heads might have<br>suggested the strange adjective which she used.”<br></p>
<p>Holmes shook his head like a man who is far from being satisfied.<br></p>
<p>“These are very deep waters,” said he; “pray go on with your narrative.”<br></p>
<p>“Two years have passed since then, and my life has been until lately<br>lonelier than ever. A month ago, however, a dear friend, whom I have<br>known for many years, has done me the honor to ask my hand in marriage.<br>His name is Armitage—Percy Armitage—the second son of Mr. Armitage,<br>of Crane Water, near Reading. My step-father has offered no opposition<br>to the match, and we are to be married in the course of the spring. Two<br>days ago some repairs were started in the west wing of the building,<br>and my bedroom wall has been pierced, so that I have had to move into<br>the chamber in which my sister died, and to sleep in the very bed in<br>which she slept. Imagine, then, my thrill of terror when last night,<br>as I lay awake, thinking over her terrible fate, I suddenly heard in<br>the silence of the night the low whistle which had been the herald of<br>her own death. I sprang up and lit the lamp, but nothing was to be<br>seen in the room. I was too shaken to go to bed again, however, so I<br>dressed, and as soon as it was daylight I slipped down, got a dog-cart<br>at the ‘Crown Inn,’ which is opposite, and drove to Leatherhead, from<br>whence I have come on this morning with the one object of seeing you<br>and asking your advice.”<br></p>
<p>“You have done wisely,” said my friend. “But have you told me all?”<br></p>
<p>“Yes, all.”<br></p>
<p>“Miss Roylott, you have not. You are screening your step-father.”<br></p>
<p>“Why, what do you mean?”<br></p>
<p>For answer Holmes pushed back the frill of black lace which fringed the<br>hand that lay upon our visitor’s knee. Five little livid spots, the<br>marks of four fingers and a thumb, were printed upon the white wrist.<br></p>
<p>“You have been cruelly used,” said Holmes.<br></p>
<p>The lady colored deeply and covered over her injured wrist. “He is a<br>hard man,” she said, “and perhaps he hardly knows his own strength.”<br></p>
<p>There was a long silence, during which Holmes leaned his chin upon his<br>hands and stared into the crackling fire.<br></p>
<p>“This is a very deep business,” he said, at last. “There are a thousand<br>details which I should desire to know before I decide upon our course<br>of action. Yet we have not a moment to lose. If we were to come to<br>Stoke Moran to-day, would it be possible for us to see over these rooms<br>without the knowledge of your step-father?”<br></p>
<p>“As it happens, he spoke of coming into town to-day upon some most<br>important business. It is probable that he will be away all day, and<br>that there would be nothing to disturb you. We have a house-keeper<br>now, but she is old and foolish, and I could easily get her out of the<br>way.”<br></p>
<p>“Excellent. You are not averse to this trip, Watson?”<br></p>
<p>“By no means.”<br></p>
<p>“Then we shall both come. What are you going to do yourself?”<br></p>
<p>“I have one or two things which I would wish to do now that I am in<br>town. But I shall return by the twelve o’clock train, so as to be there<br>in time for your coming.”<br></p>
<p>“And you may expect us early in the afternoon. I have myself some small<br>business matters to attend to. Will you not wait and breakfast?”<br></p>
<p>“No, I must go. My heart is lightened already since I have confided<br>my trouble to you. I shall look forward to seeing you again this<br>afternoon.” She dropped her thick black veil over her face and glided<br>from the room.<br></p>
<p>“And what do you think of it all, Watson?” asked Sherlock Holmes,<br>leaning back in his chair.<br></p>
<p>“It seems to me to be a most dark and sinister business.”<br></p>
<p>“Dark enough and sinister enough.”<br></p>
<p>“Yet if the lady is correct in saying that the flooring and walls are<br>sound, and that the door, window, and chimney are impassable, then her<br>sister must have been undoubtedly alone when she met her mysterious<br>end.”<br></p>
<p>“What becomes, then, of these nocturnal whistles, and what of the very<br>peculiar words of the dying woman?”<br></p>
<p>“I cannot think.”<br></p>
<p>“When you combine the ideas of whistles at night, the presence of a<br>band of gypsies who are on intimate terms with this old doctor, the<br>fact that we have every reason to believe that the doctor has an<br>interest in preventing his step-daughter’s marriage, the dying allusion<br>to a band, and, finally, the fact that Miss Helen Stoner heard a<br>metallic clang, which might have been caused by one of those metal bars<br>which secured the shutters falling back into their place, I think that<br>there is good ground to think that the mystery may be cleared along<br>those lines.”<br></p>
<p>“But what, then, did the gypsies do?”<br></p>
<p>“I cannot imagine.”<br></p>
<p>“I see many objections to any such theory.”<br></p>
<p>“And so do I. It is precisely for that reason that we are going to<br>Stoke Moran this day. I want to see whether the objections are fatal,<br>or if they may be explained away. But what in the name of the devil!”<br></p>
<p>The ejaculation had been drawn from my companion by the fact that our<br>door had been suddenly dashed open, and that a huge man had framed<br>himself in the aperture. His costume was a peculiar mixture of the<br>professional and of the agricultural, having a black top-hat, a long<br>frock-coat, and a pair of high gaiters, with a hunting-crop swinging in<br>his hand. So tall was he that his hat actually brushed the cross bar<br>of the doorway, and his breadth seemed to span it across from side to<br>side. A large face, seared with a thousand wrinkles, burned yellow with<br>the sun, and marked with every evil passion, was turned from one to the<br>other of us, while his deep-set, bile-shot eyes, and his high, thin,<br>fleshless nose, gave him somewhat the resemblance to a fierce old bird<br>of prey.<br></p>
<p>“Which of you is Holmes?” asked this apparition.<br></p>
<p>“My name, sir; but you have the advantage of me,” said my companion,<br>quietly.<br></p>
<p>“I am Dr. Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke Moran.”<br></p>
<p>“Indeed, doctor,” said Holmes, blandly. “Pray take a seat.”<br></p>
<p>“I will do nothing of the kind. My step-daughter has been here. I have<br>traced her. What has she been saying to you?”<br></p>
<p>“It is a little cold for the time of the year,” said Holmes.<br></p>
<p>“What has she been saying to you?” screamed the old man, furiously.<br></p>
<p>“But I have heard that the crocuses promise well,” continued my<br>companion, imperturbably.<br></p>
<p>“Ha! You put me off, do you?” said our new visitor, taking a step<br>forward and shaking his hunting-crop. “I know you, you scoundrel! I<br>have heard of you before. You are Holmes, the meddler.”<br></p>
<p>My friend smiled.<br></p>
<p>“Holmes, the busybody!”<br></p>
<p>His smile broadened.<br></p>
<p>“Holmes, the Scotland-yard Jack-in-office!”<br></p>
<p>Holmes chuckled heartily. “Your conversation is most entertaining,”<br>said he. “When you go out close the door, for there is a decided<br>draught.”<br></p>
<p>“I will go when I have said my say. Don’t you dare to meddle with my<br>affairs. I know that Miss Stoner has been here. I traced her! I am a<br>dangerous man to fall foul of! See here.” He stepped swiftly forward,<br>seized the poker, and bent it into a curve with his huge brown hands.<br></p>
<p>“See that you keep yourself out of my grip,” he snarled, and hurling<br>the twisted poker into the fireplace, he strode out of the room.<br></p>
<p>“He seems a very amiable person,” said Holmes, laughing. “I am not<br>quite so bulky, but if he had remained I might have shown him that my<br>grip was not much more feeble than his own.” As he spoke he picked up<br>the steel poker, and with a sudden effort straightened it out again.<br></p>
<p>“Fancy his having the insolence to confound me with the official<br>detective force! This incident gives zest to our investigation,<br>however, and I only trust that our little friend will not suffer from<br>her imprudence in allowing this brute to trace her. And now, Watson,<br>we shall order breakfast, and afterwards I shall walk down to Doctors’<br>Commons, where I hope to get some data which may help us in this<br>matter.”<br></p>
<p>       *       *       *       *       *<br></p>
<p>It was nearly one o’clock when Sherlock Holmes returned from his<br>excursion. He held in his hand a sheet of blue paper, scrawled over<br>with notes and figures.<br></p>
<p>“I have seen the will of the deceased wife,” said he. “To determine<br>its exact meaning I have been obliged to work out the present prices<br>of the investments with which it is concerned. The total income, which<br>at the time of the wife’s death was little short of £1100, is now,<br>through the fall in agricultural prices, not more than £750. Each<br>daughter can claim an income of £250, in case of marriage. It is<br>evident, therefore, that if both girls had married, this beauty would<br>have had a mere pittance, while even one of them would cripple him to<br>a very serious extent. My morning’s work has not been wasted, since it<br>has proved that he has the very strongest motives for standing in the<br>way of anything of the sort. And now, Watson, this is too serious for<br>dawdling, especially as the old man is aware that we are interesting<br>ourselves in his affairs; so if you are ready, we shall call a cab and<br>drive to Waterloo. I should be very much obliged if you would slip your<br>revolver into your pocket. An Eley’s No. 2 is an excellent argument<br>with gentlemen who can twist steel pokers into knots. That and a<br>tooth-brush are, I think, all that we need.”<br></p>
<p>At Waterloo we were fortunate in catching a train for Leatherhead,<br>where we hired a trap at the station inn, and drove for four or five<br>miles through the lovely Surrey lanes. It was a perfect day, with<br>a bright sun and a few fleecy clouds in the heavens. The trees and<br>way-side hedges were just throwing out their first green shoots, and<br>the air was full of the pleasant smell of the moist earth. To me at<br>least there was a strange contrast between the sweet promise of the<br>spring and this sinister quest upon which we were engaged. My companion<br>sat in the front of the trap, his arms folded, his hat pulled down over<br>his eyes, and his chin sunk upon his breast, buried in the deepest<br>thought. Suddenly, however, he started, tapped me on the shoulder, and<br>pointed over the meadows.<br></p>
<p>“Look there!” said he.<br></p>
<p>A heavily-timbered park stretched up in a gentle slope, thickening into<br>a grove at the highest point. From amid the branches there jutted out<br>the gray gables and high roof-tree of a very old mansion.<br></p>
<p>“Stoke Moran?” said he.<br></p>
<p>“Yes, sir, that be the house of Dr. Grimesby Roylott,” remarked the<br>driver.<br></p>
<p>“There is some building going on there,” said Holmes; “that is where we<br>are going.”<br></p>
<p>“There’s the village,” said the driver, pointing to a cluster of roofs<br>some distance to the left; “but if you want to get to the house, you’ll<br>find it shorter to get over this stile, and so by the foot-path over<br>the fields. There it is, where the lady is walking.”<br></p>
<p>“And the lady, I fancy, is Miss Stoner,” observed Holmes, shading his<br>eyes. “Yes, I think we had better do as you suggest.”<br></p>
<p>We got off, paid our fare, and the trap rattled back on its way to<br>Leatherhead.<br></p>
<p>“I thought it as well,” said Holmes, as we climbed the stile, “that<br>this fellow should think we had come here as architects, or on some<br>definite business. It may stop his gossip. Good-afternoon, Miss Stoner.<br>You see that we have been as good as our word.”<br></p>
<p>Our client of the morning had hurried forward to meet us with a face<br>which spoke her joy. “I have been waiting so eagerly for you,” she<br>cried, shaking hands with us warmly. “All has turned out splendidly.<br>Dr. Roylott has gone to town, and it is unlikely that he will be back<br>before evening.”<br></p>
<p>“We have had the pleasure of making the doctor’s acquaintance,” said<br>Holmes, and in a few words he sketched out what had occurred. Miss<br>Stoner turned white to the lips as she listened.<br></p>
<p>“Good heavens!” she cried, “he has followed me, then.”<br></p>
<p>“So it appears.”<br></p>
<p>“He is so cunning that I never know when I am safe from him. What will<br>he say when he returns?”<br></p>
<p>“He must guard himself, for he may find that there is some one more<br>cunning than himself upon his track. You must lock yourself up from him<br>to-night. If he is violent, we shall take you away to your aunt’s at<br>Harrow. Now, we must make the best use of our time, so kindly take us<br>at once to the rooms which we are to examine.”<br></p>
<p>The building was of gray, lichen-blotched stone, with a high central<br>portion, and two curving wings, like the claws of a crab, thrown out<br>on each side. In one of these wings the windows were broken, and<br>blocked with wooden boards, while the roof was partly caved in, a<br>picture of ruin. The central portion was in little better repair, but<br>the right-hand block was comparatively modern, and the blinds in the<br>windows, with the blue smoke curling up from the chimneys, showed that<br>this was where the family resided. Some scaffolding had been erected<br>against the end wall, and the stone-work had been broken into, but<br>there were no signs of any workmen at the moment of our visit. Holmes<br>walked slowly up and down the ill-trimmed lawn, and examined with deep<br>attention the outsides of the windows.<br></p>
<p>“This, I take it, belongs to the room in which you used to sleep, the<br>centre one to your sister’s, and the one next to the main building to<br>Dr. Roylott’s chamber?”<br></p>
<p>“Exactly so. But I am now sleeping in the middle one.”<br></p>
<p>“Pending the alterations, as I understand. By-the-way, there does not<br>seem to be any very pressing need for repairs at that end wall.”<br></p>
<p>“There were none. I believe that it was an excuse to move me from my<br>room.”<br></p>
<p>“Ah! that is suggestive. Now, on the other side of this narrow wing<br>runs the corridor from which these three rooms open. There are windows<br>in it, of course?”<br></p>
<p>“Yes, but very small ones. Too narrow for any one to pass through.”<br></p>
<p>“As you both locked your doors at night, your rooms were unapproachable<br>from that side. Now, would you have the kindness to go into your room<br>and bar your shutters.”<br></p>
<p>Miss Stoner did so, and Holmes, after a careful examination through<br>the open window, endeavored in every way to force the shutter open,<br>but without success. There was no slit through which a knife could be<br>passed to raise the bar. Then with his lens he tested the hinges, but<br>they were of solid iron, built firmly into the massive masonry. “Hum!”<br>said he, scratching his chin in some perplexity; “my theory certainly<br>presents some difficulties. No one could pass these shutters if they<br>were bolted. Well, we shall see if the inside throws any light upon the<br>matter.”<br></p>
<p>A small side door led into the whitewashed corridor from which the<br>three bedrooms opened. Holmes refused to examine the third chamber,<br>so we passed at once to the second, that in which Miss Stoner was now<br>sleeping, and in which her sister had met with her fate. It was a<br>homely little room, with a low ceiling and a gaping fireplace, after<br>the fashion of old country-houses. A brown chest of drawers stood<br>in one corner, a narrow white-counterpaned bed in another, and a<br>dressing-table on the left-hand side of the window. These articles,<br>with two small wicker-work chairs, made up all the furniture in the<br>room, save for a square of Wilton carpet in the centre. The boards<br>round and the panelling of the walls were of brown, worm-eaten oak, so<br>old and discolored that it may have dated from the original building of<br>the house. Holmes drew one of the chairs into a corner and sat silent,<br>while his eyes travelled round and round and up and down, taking in<br>every detail of the apartment.<br></p>
<p>“Where does that bell communicate with?” he asked, at last, pointing to<br>a thick bell-rope which hung down beside the bed, the tassel actually<br>lying upon the pillow.<br></p>
<p>“It goes to the house-keeper’s room.”<br></p>
<p>“It looks newer than the other things?”<br></p>
<p>“Yes, it was only put there a couple of years ago.”<br></p>
<p>“Your sister asked for it, I suppose?”<br></p>
<p>“No, I never heard of her using it. We used always to get what we<br>wanted for ourselves.”<br></p>
<p>“Indeed, it seemed unnecessary to put so nice a bell-pull there. You<br>will excuse me for a few minutes while I satisfy myself as to this<br>floor.” He threw himself down upon his face with his lens in his hand,<br>and crawled swiftly backward and forward, examining minutely the cracks<br>between the boards. Then he did the same with the wood-work with which<br>the chamber was panelled. Finally he walked over to the bed, and spent<br>some time in staring at it, and in running his eye up and down the<br>wall. Finally he took the bell-rope in his hand and gave it a brisk tug.<br></p>
<p>“Why, it’s a dummy,” said he.<br></p>
<p>“Won’t it ring?”<br></p>
<p>“No, it is not even attached to a wire. This is very interesting. You<br>can see now that it is fastened to a hook just above where the little<br>opening for the ventilator is.”<br></p>
<p>“How very absurd! I never noticed that before.”<br></p>
<p>“Very strange!” muttered Holmes, pulling at the rope. “There are one or<br>two very singular points about this room. For example, what a fool a<br>builder must be to open a ventilator into another room, when, with the<br>same trouble, he might have communicated with the outside air!”<br></p>
<p>“That is also quite modern,” said the lady.<br></p>
<p>“Done about the same time as the bell-rope?” remarked Holmes.<br></p>
<p>“Yes, there were several little changes carried out about that time.”<br></p>
<p>“They seem to have been of a most interesting character—dummy<br>bell-ropes, and ventilators which do not ventilate. With your<br>permission, Miss Stoner, we shall now carry our researches into the<br>inner apartment.”<br></p>
<p>Dr. Grimesby Roylott’s chamber was larger than that of his<br>step-daughter, but was as plainly furnished. A camp-bed, a small wooden<br>shelf full of books, mostly of a technical character, an arm-chair<br>beside the bed, a plain wooden chair against the wall, a round table,<br>and a large iron safe were the principal things which met the eye.<br>Holmes walked slowly round and examined each and all of them with the<br>keenest interest.<br></p>
<p>“What’s in here?” he asked, tapping the safe.<br></p>
<p>“My step-father’s business papers.”<br></p>
<p>“Oh! you have seen inside, then?”<br></p>
<p>“Only once, some years ago. I remember that it was full of papers.”<br></p>
<p>“There isn’t a cat in it, for example?”<br></p>
<p>“No. What a strange idea!”<br></p>
<p>“Well, look at this!” He took up a small saucer of milk which stood on<br>the top of it.<br></p>
<p>“No; we don’t keep a cat. But there is a cheetah and a baboon.”<br></p>
<p>“Ah, yes, of course! Well, a cheetah is just a big cat, and yet a<br>saucer of milk does not go very far in satisfying its wants, I dare<br>say. There is one point which I should wish to determine.” He squatted<br>down in front of the wooden chair, and examined the seat of it with the<br>greatest attention.<br></p>
<p>“Thank you. That is quite settled,” said he, rising and putting his<br>lens in his pocket. “Hello! Here is something interesting!”<br></p>
<p>The object which had caught his eye was a small dog-lash hung on one<br>corner of the bed. The lash, however, was curled upon itself, and tied<br>so as to make a loop of whip-cord.<br></p>
<p>“What do you make of that, Watson?”<br></p>
<p>“It’s a common enough lash. But I don’t know why it should be tied.”<br></p>
<p>“That is not quite so common, is it? Ah, me! it’s a wicked world,<br>and when a clever man turns his brains to crime it is the worst of<br>all. I think that I have seen enough now, Miss Stoner, and with your<br>permission we shall walk out upon the lawn.”<br></p>
<p>I had never seen my friend’s face so grim or his brow so dark as it<br>was when we turned from the scene of this investigation. We had walked<br>several times up and down the lawn, neither Miss Stoner nor myself<br>liking to break in upon his thoughts before he roused himself from his<br>reverie.<br></p>
<p>“It is very essential, Miss Stoner,” said he, “that you should<br>absolutely follow my advice in every respect.”<br></p>
<p>“I shall most certainly do so.”<br></p>
<p>“The matter is too serious for any hesitation. Your life may depend<br>upon your compliance.”<br></p>
<p>“I assure you that I am in your hands.”<br></p>
<p>“In the first place, both my friend and I must spend the night in your<br>room.”<br></p>
<p>Both Miss Stoner and I gazed at him in astonishment.<br></p>
<p>“Yes, it must be so. Let me explain. I believe that that is the village<br>inn over there?”<br></p>
<p>“Yes, that is the ‘Crown.’”<br></p>
<p>“Very good. Your windows would be visible from there?”<br></p>
<p>“Certainly.”<br></p>
<p>“You must confine yourself to your room, on pretence of a headache,<br>when your step-father comes back. Then when you hear him retire for<br>the night, you must open the shutters of your window, undo the hasp,<br>put your lamp there as a signal to us, and then withdraw quietly with<br>everything which you are likely to want into the room which you used to<br>occupy. I have no doubt that, in spite of the repairs, you could manage<br>there for one night.”<br></p>
<p>“Oh yes, easily.”<br></p>
<p>“The rest you will leave in our hands.”<br></p>
<p>“But what will you do?”<br></p>
<p>“We shall spend the night in your room, and we shall investigate the<br>cause of this noise which has disturbed you.”<br></p>
<p>“I believe, Mr. Holmes, that you have already made up your mind,” said<br>Miss Stoner, laying her hand upon my companion’s sleeve.<br></p>
<p>“Perhaps I have.”<br></p>
<p>“Then for pity’s sake tell me what was the cause of my sister’s death.”<br></p>
<p>“I should prefer to have clearer proofs before I speak.”<br></p>
<p>“You can at least tell me whether my own thought is correct, and if she<br>died from some sudden fright.”<br></p>
<p>[Illustration: “‘GOOD-BYE, AND BE BRAVE’”]<br></p>
<p>“No, I do not think so. I think that there was probably some more<br>tangible cause. And now, Miss Stoner, we must leave you, for if Dr.<br>Roylott returned and saw us, our journey would be in vain. Good-bye,<br>and be brave, for if you will do what I have told you, you may rest<br>assured that we shall soon drive away the dangers that threaten you.”<br></p>
<p>Sherlock Holmes and I had no difficulty in engaging a bedroom and<br>sitting-room at the “Crown Inn.” They were on the upper floor, and<br>from our window we could command a view of the avenue gate, and of the<br>inhabited wing of Stoke Moran Manor House. At dusk we saw Dr. Grimesby<br>Roylott drive past, his huge form looming up beside the little figure<br>of the lad who drove him. The boy had some slight difficulty in undoing<br>the heavy iron gates, and we heard the hoarse roar of the doctor’s<br>voice, and saw the fury with which he shook his clinched fists at him.<br>The trap drove on, and a few minutes later we saw a sudden light spring<br>up among the trees as the lamp was lit in one of the sitting-rooms.<br></p>
<p>“Do you know, Watson,” said Holmes, as we sat together in the gathering<br>darkness, “I have really some scruples as to taking you to-night. There<br>is a distinct element of danger.”<br></p>
<p>“Can I be of assistance?”<br></p>
<p>“Your presence might be invaluable.”<br></p>
<p>“Then I shall certainly come.”<br></p>
<p>“It is very kind of you.”<br></p>
<p>“You speak of danger. You have evidently seen more in these rooms than<br>was visible to me.”<br></p>
<p>“No, but I fancy that I may have deduced a little more. I imagine that<br>you saw all that I did.”<br></p>
<p>“I saw nothing remarkable save the bell-rope, and what purpose that<br>could answer I confess is more than I can imagine.”<br></p>
<p>“You saw the ventilator, too?”<br></p>
<p>“Yes, but I do not think that it is such a very unusual thing to have<br>a small opening between two rooms. It was so small that a rat could<br>hardly pass through.”<br></p>
<p>“I knew that we should find a ventilator before ever we came to Stoke<br>Moran.”<br></p>
<p>“My dear Holmes!”<br></p>
<p>“Oh yes, I did. You remember in her statement she said that her sister<br>could smell Dr. Roylott’s cigar. Now, of course that suggested at once<br>that there must be a communication between the two rooms. It could only<br>be a small one, or it would have been remarked upon at the coroner’s<br>inquiry. I deduced a ventilator.”<br></p>
<p>“But what harm can there be in that?”<br></p>
<p>“Well, there is at least a curious coincidence of dates. A ventilator<br>is made, a cord is hung, and a lady who sleeps in the bed dies. Does<br>not that strike you?”<br></p>
<p>“I cannot as yet see any connection.”<br></p>
<p>“Did you observe anything very peculiar about that bed?”<br></p>
<p>“No.”<br></p>
<p>“It was clamped to the floor. Did you ever see a bed fastened like that<br>before?”<br></p>
<p>“I cannot say that I have.”<br></p>
<p>“The lady could not move her bed. It must always be in the same<br>relative position to the ventilator and to the rope—for so we may call<br>it, since it was clearly never meant for a bell-pull.”<br></p>
<p>“Holmes,” I cried, “I seem to see dimly what you are hinting at. We are<br>only just in time to prevent some subtle and horrible crime.”<br></p>
<p>“Subtle enough and horrible enough. When a doctor does go wrong, he is<br>the first of criminals. He has nerve and he has knowledge. Palmer and<br>Pritchard were among the heads of their profession. This man strikes<br>even deeper, but I think, Watson, that we shall be able to strike<br>deeper still. But we shall have horrors enough before the night is<br>over; for goodness’ sake let us have a quiet pipe, and turn our minds<br>for a few hours to something more cheerful.”<br></p>
<p>       *       *       *       *       *<br></p>
<p>About nine o’clock the light among the trees was extinguished, and all<br>was dark in the direction of the Manor House. Two hours passed slowly<br>away, and then, suddenly, just at the stroke of eleven, a single<br>bright light shone out right in front of us.<br></p>
<p>“That is our signal,” said Holmes, springing to his feet; “it comes<br>from the middle window.”<br></p>
<p>As we passed out he exchanged a few words with the landlord, explaining<br>that we were going on a late visit to an acquaintance, and that it was<br>possible that we might spend the night there. A moment later we were<br>out on the dark road, a chill wind blowing in our faces, and one yellow<br>light twinkling in front of us through the gloom to guide us on our<br>sombre errand.<br></p>
<p>There was little difficulty in entering the grounds, for unrepaired<br>breaches gaped in the old park wall. Making our way among the trees,<br>we reached the lawn, crossed it, and were about to enter through the<br>window, when out from a clump of laurel bushes there darted what seemed<br>to be a hideous and distorted child, who threw itself upon the grass<br>with writhing limbs, and then ran swiftly across the lawn into the<br>darkness.<br></p>
<p>“My God!” I whispered; “did you see it?”<br></p>
<p>Holmes was for the moment as startled as I. His hand closed like a vice<br>upon my wrist in his agitation. Then he broke into a low laugh, and put<br>his lips to my ear.<br></p>
<p>“It is a nice household,” he murmured. “That is the baboon.”<br></p>
<p>I had forgotten the strange pets which the doctor affected. There was<br>a cheetah, too; perhaps we might find it upon our shoulders at any<br>moment. I confess that I felt easier in my mind when, after following<br>Holmes’s example and slipping off my shoes, I found myself inside the<br>bedroom. My companion noiselessly closed the shutters, moved the lamp<br>onto the table, and cast his eyes round the room. All was as we had<br>seen it in the daytime. Then creeping up to me and making a trumpet of<br>his hand, he whispered into my ear again so gently that it was all that<br>I could do to distinguish the words:<br></p>
<p>“The least sound would be fatal to our plans.”<br></p>
<p>I nodded to show that I had heard.<br></p>
<p>“We must sit without light. He would see it through the ventilator.”<br></p>
<p>I nodded again.<br></p>
<p>“Do not go asleep; your very life may depend upon it. Have your pistol<br>ready in case we should need it. I will sit on the side of the bed, and<br>you in that chair.”<br></p>
<p>I took out my revolver and laid it on the corner of the table.<br></p>
<p>Holmes had brought up a long thin cane, and this he placed upon the bed<br>beside him. By it he laid the box of matches and the stump of a candle.<br>Then he turned down the lamp, and we were left in darkness.<br></p>
<p>How shall I ever forget that dreadful vigil? I could not hear a sound,<br>not even the drawing of a breath, and yet I knew that my companion<br>sat open-eyed, within a few feet of me, in the same state of nervous<br>tension in which I was myself. The shutters cut off the least ray<br>of light, and we waited in absolute darkness. From outside came the<br>occasional cry of a night-bird, and once at our very window a long<br>drawn cat-like whine, which told us that the cheetah was indeed at<br>liberty. Far away we could hear the deep tones of the parish clock,<br>which boomed out every quarter of an hour. How long they seemed, those<br>quarters! Twelve struck, and one and two and three, and still we sat<br>waiting silently for whatever might befall.<br></p>
<p>Suddenly there was the momentary gleam of a light up in the direction<br>of the ventilator, which vanished immediately, but was succeeded by<br>a strong smell of burning oil and heated metal. Some one in the next<br>room had lit a dark-lantern. I heard a gentle sound of movement, and<br>then all was silent once more, though the smell grew stronger. For half<br>an hour I sat with straining ears. Then suddenly another sound became<br>audible—a very gentle, soothing sound, like that of a small jet of<br>steam escaping continually from a kettle. The instant that we heard it,<br>Holmes sprang from the bed, struck a match, and lashed furiously with<br>his cane at the bell-pull.<br></p>
<p>“You see it, Watson?” he yelled. “You see it?”<br></p>
<p>But I saw nothing. At the moment when Holmes struck the light I heard<br>a low, clear whistle, but the sudden glare flashing into my weary eyes<br>made it impossible for me to tell what it was at which my friend lashed<br>so savagely. I could, however, see that his face was deadly pale, and<br>filled with horror and loathing.<br></p>
<p>He had ceased to strike, and was gazing up at the ventilator, when<br>suddenly there broke from the silence of the night the most horrible<br>cry to which I have ever listened. It swelled up louder and louder, a<br>hoarse yell of pain and fear and anger all mingled in the one dreadful<br>shriek. They say that away down in the village, and even in the distant<br>parsonage, that cry raised the sleepers from their beds. It struck cold<br>to our hearts, and I stood gazing at Holmes, and he at me, until the<br>last echoes of it had died away into the silence from which it rose.<br></p>
<p>“What can it mean?” I gasped.<br></p>
<p>“It means that it is all over,” Holmes answered. “And perhaps, after<br>all, it is for the best. Take your pistol, and we will enter Dr.<br>Roylott’s room.”<br></p>
<p>With a grave face he lit the lamp and led the way down the corridor.<br>Twice he struck at the chamber door without any reply from within.<br>Then he turned the handle and entered, I at his heels, with the cocked<br>pistol in my hand.<br></p>
<p>It was a singular sight which met our eyes. On the table stood a<br>dark-lantern with the shutter half open, throwing a brilliant beam<br>of light upon the iron safe, the door of which was ajar. Beside this<br>table, on the wooden chair, sat Dr. Grimesby Roylott, clad in a long<br>gray dressing-gown, his bare ankles protruding beneath, and his feet<br>thrust into red heelless Turkish slippers. Across his lap lay the short<br>stock with the long lash which we had noticed during the day. His chin<br>was cocked upward and his eyes were fixed in a dreadful, rigid stare<br>at the corner of the ceiling. Round his brow he had a peculiar yellow<br>band, with brownish speckles, which seemed to be bound tightly round<br>his head. As we entered he made neither sound nor motion.<br></p>
<p>“The band! the speckled band!” whispered Holmes.<br></p>
<p>I took a step forward. In an instant his strange head-gear began<br>to move, and there reared itself from among his hair the squat<br>diamond-shaped head and puffed neck of a loathsome serpent.<br></p>
<p>“It is a swamp adder!” cried Holmes; “the deadliest snake in India. He<br>has died within ten seconds of being bitten. Violence does, in truth,<br>recoil upon the violent, and the schemer falls into the pit which he<br>digs for another. Let us thrust this creature back into its den, and<br>we can then remove Miss Stoner to some place of shelter, and let the<br>county police know what has happened.”<br></p>
<p>As he spoke he drew the dog-whip swiftly from the dead man’s lap, and<br>throwing the noose round the reptile’s neck, he drew it from its horrid<br>perch, and carrying it at arm’s length, threw it into the iron safe,<br>which he closed upon it.<br></p>
<p>       *       *       *       *       *<br></p>
<p>Such are the true facts of the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke<br>Moran. It is not necessary that I should prolong a narrative which has<br>already run to too great a length, by telling how we broke the sad news<br>to the terrified girl, how we conveyed her by the morning train to the<br>care of her good aunt at Harrow, of how the slow process of official<br>inquiry came to the conclusion that the doctor met his fate while<br>indiscreetly playing with a dangerous pet. The little which I had yet<br>to learn of the case was told me by Sherlock Holmes as we travelled<br>back next day.<br></p>
<p>“I had,” said he, “come to an entirely erroneous conclusion, which<br>shows, my dear Watson, how dangerous it always is to reason from<br>insufficient data. The presence of the gypsies, and the use of the<br>word ‘band,’ which was used by the poor girl, no doubt to explain the<br>appearance which she had caught a hurried glimpse of by the light of<br>her match, were sufficient to put me upon an entirely wrong scent. I<br>can only claim the merit that I instantly reconsidered my position<br>when, however, it became clear to me that whatever danger threatened<br>an occupant of the room could not come either from the window or the<br>door. My attention was speedily drawn, as I have already remarked to<br>you, to this ventilator, and to the bell-rope which hung down to the<br>bed. The discovery that this was a dummy, and that the bed was clamped<br>to the floor, instantly gave rise to the suspicion that the rope was<br>there as bridge for something passing through the hole, and coming<br>to the bed. The idea of a snake instantly occurred to me, and when<br>I coupled it with my knowledge that the doctor was furnished with a<br>supply of creatures from India, I felt that I was probably on the right<br>track. The idea of using a form of poison which could not possibly be<br>discovered by any chemical test was just such a one as would occur to a<br>clever and ruthless man who had had an Eastern training. The rapidity<br>with which such a poison would take effect would also, from his point<br>of view, be an advantage. It would be a sharp-eyed coroner, indeed, who<br>could distinguish the two little dark punctures which would show where<br>the poison fangs had done their work. Then I thought of the whistle. Of<br>course he must recall the snake before the morning light revealed it to<br>the victim. He had trained it, probably by the use of the milk which<br>we saw, to return to him when summoned. He would put it through this<br>ventilator at the hour that he thought best, with the certainty that it<br>would crawl down the rope and land on the bed. It might or might not<br>bite the occupant, perhaps she might escape every night for a week, but<br>sooner or later she must fall a victim.<br></p>
<p>“I had come to these conclusions before ever I had entered his room.<br>An inspection of his chair showed me that he had been in the habit of<br>standing on it, which of course would be necessary in order that he<br>should reach the ventilator. The sight of the safe, the saucer of milk,<br>and the loop of whip-cord were enough to finally dispel any doubts<br>which may have remained. The metallic clang heard by Miss Stoner was<br>obviously caused by her step-father hastily closing the door of his<br>safe upon its terrible occupant. Having once made up my mind, you know<br>the steps which I took in order to put the matter to the proof. I<br>heard the creature hiss, as I have no doubt that you did also, and I<br>instantly lit the light and attacked it.”<br></p>
<p>“With the result of driving it through the ventilator.”<br></p>
<p>“And also with the result of causing it to turn upon its master at the<br>other side. Some of the blows of my cane came home, and roused its<br>snakish temper, so that it flew upon the first person it saw. In this<br>way I am no doubt indirectly responsible for Dr. Grimesby Roylott’s<br>death, and I cannot say that it is likely to weigh very heavily upon my<br>conscience.”<br></p>
