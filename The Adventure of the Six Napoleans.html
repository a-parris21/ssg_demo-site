        <h1>THE ADVENTURE OF THE SIX NAPOLEONS</h1>
        <p>It was no very unusual thing for Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard,<br>to look in upon us of an evening, and his visits were welcome to<br>Sherlock Holmes, for they enabled him to keep in touch with all<br>that was going on at the police headquarters. In return for the<br>news which Lestrade would bring, Holmes was always ready to<br>listen with attention to the details of any case upon which the<br>detective was engaged, and was able occasionally, without any<br>active interference, to give some hint or suggestion drawn from<br>his own vast knowledge and experience.<br></p>
<p>On this particular evening, Lestrade had spoken of the weather<br>and the newspapers. Then he had fallen silent, puffing<br>thoughtfully at his cigar. Holmes looked keenly at him.<br></p>
<p>“Anything remarkable on hand?” he asked.<br></p>
<p>“Oh, no, Mr. Holmes—nothing very particular.”<br></p>
<p>“Then tell me about it.”<br></p>
<p>Lestrade laughed.<br></p>
<p>“Well, Mr. Holmes, there is no use denying that there _is_<br>something on my mind. And yet it is such an absurd business, that<br>I hesitated to bother you about it. On the other hand, although<br>it is trivial, it is undoubtedly queer, and I know that you have<br>a taste for all that is out of the common. But, in my opinion, it<br>comes more in Dr. Watson’s line than ours.”<br></p>
<p>“Disease?” said I.<br></p>
<p>“Madness, anyhow. And a queer madness, too. You wouldn’t think<br>there was anyone living at this time of day who had such a hatred<br>of Napoleon the First that he would break any image of him that<br>he could see.”<br></p>
<p>Holmes sank back in his chair.<br></p>
<p>“That’s no business of mine,” said he.<br></p>
<p>“Exactly. That’s what I said. But then, when the man commits<br>burglary in order to break images which are not his own, that<br>brings it away from the doctor and on to the policeman.”<br></p>
<p>Holmes sat up again.<br></p>
<p>“Burglary! This is more interesting. Let me hear the details.”<br></p>
<p>Lestrade took out his official notebook and refreshed his memory<br>from its pages.<br></p>
<p>“The first case reported was four days ago,” said he. “It was at<br>the shop of Morse Hudson, who has a place for the sale of<br>pictures and statues in the Kennington Road. The assistant had<br>left the front shop for an instant, when he heard a crash, and<br>hurrying in he found a plaster bust of Napoleon, which stood with<br>several other works of art upon the counter, lying shivered into<br>fragments. He rushed out into the road, but, although several<br>passers-by declared that they had noticed a man run out of the<br>shop, he could neither see anyone nor could he find any means of<br>identifying the rascal. It seemed to be one of those senseless<br>acts of hooliganism which occur from time to time, and it was<br>reported to the constable on the beat as such. The plaster cast<br>was not worth more than a few shillings, and the whole affair<br>appeared to be too childish for any particular investigation.<br></p>
<p>“The second case, however, was more serious, and also more<br>singular. It occurred only last night.<br></p>
<p>“In Kennington Road, and within a few hundred yards of Morse<br>Hudson’s shop, there lives a well-known medical practitioner,<br>named Dr. Barnicot, who has one of the largest practices upon the<br>south side of the Thames. His residence and principal<br>consulting-room is at Kennington Road, but he has a branch<br>surgery and dispensary at Lower Brixton Road, two miles away.<br>This Dr. Barnicot is an enthusiastic admirer of Napoleon, and his<br>house is full of books, pictures, and relics of the French<br>Emperor. Some little time ago he purchased from Morse Hudson two<br>duplicate plaster casts of the famous head of Napoleon by the<br>French sculptor, Devine. One of these he placed in his hall in<br>the house at Kennington Road, and the other on the mantelpiece of<br>the surgery at Lower Brixton. Well, when Dr. Barnicot came down<br>this morning he was astonished to find that his house had been<br>burgled during the night, but that nothing had been taken save<br>the plaster head from the hall. It had been carried out and had<br>been dashed savagely against the garden wall, under which its<br>splintered fragments were discovered.”<br></p>
<p>Holmes rubbed his hands.<br></p>
<p>“This is certainly very novel,” said he.<br></p>
<p>“I thought it would please you. But I have not got to the end<br>yet. Dr. Barnicot was due at his surgery at twelve o’clock, and<br>you can imagine his amazement when, on arriving there, he found<br>that the window had been opened in the night and that the broken<br>pieces of his second bust were strewn all over the room. It had<br>been smashed to atoms where it stood. In neither case were there<br>any signs which could give us a clue as to the criminal or<br>lunatic who had done the mischief. Now, Mr. Holmes, you have got<br>the facts.”<br></p>
<p>“They are singular, not to say grotesque,” said Holmes. “May I<br>ask whether the two busts smashed in Dr. Barnicot’s rooms were<br>the exact duplicates of the one which was destroyed in Morse<br>Hudson’s shop?”<br></p>
<p>“They were taken from the same mould.”<br></p>
<p>“Such a fact must tell against the theory that the man who breaks<br>them is influenced by any general hatred of Napoleon. Considering<br>how many hundreds of statues of the great Emperor must exist in<br>London, it is too much to suppose such a coincidence as that a<br>promiscuous iconoclast should chance to begin upon three<br>specimens of the same bust.”<br></p>
<p>“Well, I thought as you do,” said Lestrade. “On the other hand,<br>this Morse Hudson is the purveyor of busts in that part of<br>London, and these three were the only ones which had been in his<br>shop for years. So, although, as you say, there are many hundreds<br>of statues in London, it is very probable that these three were<br>the only ones in that district. Therefore, a local fanatic would<br>begin with them. What do you think, Dr. Watson?”<br></p>
<p>“There are no limits to the possibilities of monomania,” I<br>answered. “There is the condition which the modern French<br>psychologists have called the _idée fixe_, which may be trifling<br>in character, and accompanied by complete sanity in every other<br>way. A man who had read deeply about Napoleon, or who had<br>possibly received some hereditary family injury through the great<br>war, might conceivably form such an _idée fixe_ and under its<br>influence be capable of any fantastic outrage.”<br></p>
<p>“That won’t do, my dear Watson,” said Holmes, shaking his head,<br>“for no amount of _idée fixe_ would enable your interesting<br>monomaniac to find out where these busts were situated.”<br></p>
<p>“Well, how do _you_ explain it?”<br></p>
<p>“I don’t attempt to do so. I would only observe that there is a<br>certain method in the gentleman’s eccentric proceedings. For<br>example, in Dr. Barnicot’s hall, where a sound might arouse the<br>family, the bust was taken outside before being broken, whereas<br>in the surgery, where there was less danger of an alarm, it was<br>smashed where it stood. The affair seems absurdly trifling, and<br>yet I dare call nothing trivial when I reflect that some of my<br>most classic cases have had the least promising commencement. You<br>will remember, Watson, how the dreadful business of the Abernetty<br>family was first brought to my notice by the depth which the<br>parsley had sunk into the butter upon a hot day. I can’t afford,<br>therefore, to smile at your three broken busts, Lestrade, and I<br>shall be very much obliged to you if you will let me hear of any<br>fresh development of so singular a chain of events.”<br></p>
<p>The development for which my friend had asked came in a quicker<br>and an infinitely more tragic form than he could have imagined. I<br>was still dressing in my bedroom next morning, when there was a<br>tap at the door and Holmes entered, a telegram in his hand. He<br>read it aloud:<br></p>
<p>“Come instantly, 131, Pitt Street, Kensington.—LESTRADE.”<br></p>
<p>“What is it, then?” I asked.<br></p>
<p>“Don’t know—may be anything. But I suspect it is the sequel of<br>the story of the statues. In that case our friend the<br>image-breaker has begun operations in another quarter of London.<br>There’s coffee on the table, Watson, and I have a cab at the<br>door.”<br></p>
<p>In half an hour we had reached Pitt Street, a quiet little<br>backwater just beside one of the briskest currents of London<br>life. No. 131 was one of a row, all flat-chested, respectable,<br>and most unromantic dwellings. As we drove up, we found the<br>railings in front of the house lined by a curious crowd. Holmes<br>whistled.<br></p>
<p>“By George! It’s attempted murder at the least. Nothing less will<br>hold the London message-boy. There’s a deed of violence indicated<br>in that fellow’s round shoulders and outstretched neck. What’s<br>this, Watson? The top steps swilled down and the other ones dry.<br>Footsteps enough, anyhow! Well, well, there’s Lestrade at the<br>front window, and we shall soon know all about it.”<br></p>
<p>The official received us with a very grave face and showed us<br>into a sitting-room, where an exceedingly unkempt and agitated<br>elderly man, clad in a flannel dressing-gown, was pacing up and<br>down. He was introduced to us as the owner of the house—Mr.<br>Horace Harker, of the Central Press Syndicate.<br></p>
<p>“It’s the Napoleon bust business again,” said Lestrade. “You<br>seemed interested last night, Mr. Holmes, so I thought perhaps<br>you would be glad to be present now that the affair has taken a<br>very much graver turn.”<br></p>
<p>“What has it turned to, then?”<br></p>
<p>“To murder. Mr. Harker, will you tell these gentlemen exactly<br>what has occurred?”<br></p>
<p>The man in the dressing-gown turned upon us with a most<br>melancholy face.<br></p>
<p>“It’s an extraordinary thing,” said he, “that all my life I have<br>been collecting other people’s news, and now that a real piece of<br>news has come my own way I am so confused and bothered that I<br>can’t put two words together. If I had come in here as a<br>journalist, I should have interviewed myself and had two columns<br>in every evening paper. As it is, I am giving away valuable copy<br>by telling my story over and over to a string of different<br>people, and I can make no use of it myself. However, I’ve heard<br>your name, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, and if you’ll only explain this<br>queer business, I shall be paid for my trouble in telling you the<br>story.”<br></p>
<p>Holmes sat down and listened.<br></p>
<p>“It all seems to centre round that bust of Napoleon which I<br>bought for this very room about four months ago. I picked it up<br>cheap from Harding Brothers, two doors from the High Street<br>Station. A great deal of my journalistic work is done at night,<br>and I often write until the early morning. So it was to-day. I<br>was sitting in my den, which is at the back of the top of the<br>house, about three o’clock, when I was convinced that I heard<br>some sounds downstairs. I listened, but they were not repeated,<br>and I concluded that they came from outside. Then suddenly, about<br>five minutes later, there came a most horrible yell—the most<br>dreadful sound, Mr. Holmes, that ever I heard. It will ring in my<br>ears as long as I live. I sat frozen with horror for a minute or<br>two. Then I seized the poker and went downstairs. When I entered<br>this room I found the window wide open, and I at once observed<br>that the bust was gone from the mantelpiece. Why any burglar<br>should take such a thing passes my understanding, for it was only<br>a plaster cast and of no real value whatever.<br></p>
<p>“You can see for yourself that anyone going out through that open<br>window could reach the front doorstep by taking a long stride.<br>This was clearly what the burglar had done, so I went round and<br>opened the door. Stepping out into the dark, I nearly fell over a<br>dead man, who was lying there. I ran back for a light and there<br>was the poor fellow, a great gash in his throat and the whole<br>place swimming in blood. He lay on his back, his knees drawn up,<br>and his mouth horribly open. I shall see him in my dreams. I had<br>just time to blow on my police-whistle, and then I must have<br>fainted, for I knew nothing more until I found the policeman<br>standing over me in the hall.”<br></p>
<p>“Well, who was the murdered man?” asked Holmes.<br></p>
<p>“There’s nothing to show who he was,” said Lestrade. “You shall<br>see the body at the mortuary, but we have made nothing of it up<br>to now. He is a tall man, sunburned, very powerful, not more than<br>thirty. He is poorly dressed, and yet does not appear to be a<br>labourer. A horn-handled clasp knife was lying in a pool of blood<br>beside him. Whether it was the weapon which did the deed, or<br>whether it belonged to the dead man, I do not know. There was no<br>name on his clothing, and nothing in his pockets save an apple,<br>some string, a shilling map of London, and a photograph. Here it<br>is.”<br></p>
<p>It was evidently taken by a snapshot from a small camera. It<br>represented an alert, sharp-featured simian man, with thick<br>eyebrows and a very peculiar projection of the lower part of the<br>face, like the muzzle of a baboon.<br></p>
<p>“And what became of the bust?” asked Holmes, after a careful<br>study of this picture.<br></p>
<p>“We had news of it just before you came. It has been found in the<br>front garden of an empty house in Campden House Road. It was<br>broken into fragments. I am going round now to see it. Will you<br>come?”<br></p>
<p>“Certainly. I must just take one look round.” He examined the<br>carpet and the window. “The fellow had either very long legs or<br>was a most active man,” said he. “With an area beneath, it was no<br>mean feat to reach that window ledge and open that window.<br>Getting back was comparatively simple. Are you coming with us to<br>see the remains of your bust, Mr. Harker?”<br></p>
<p>The disconsolate journalist had seated himself at a<br>writing-table.<br></p>
<p>“I must try and make something of it,” said he, “though I have no<br>doubt that the first editions of the evening papers are out<br>already with full details. It’s like my luck! You remember when<br>the stand fell at Doncaster? Well, I was the only journalist in<br>the stand, and my journal the only one that had no account of it,<br>for I was too shaken to write it. And now I’ll be too late with a<br>murder done on my own doorstep.”<br></p>
<p>As we left the room, we heard his pen travelling shrilly over the<br>foolscap.<br></p>
<p>The spot where the fragments of the bust had been found was only<br>a few hundred yards away. For the first time our eyes rested upon<br>this presentment of the great emperor, which seemed to raise such<br>frantic and destructive hatred in the mind of the unknown. It lay<br>scattered, in splintered shards, upon the grass. Holmes picked up<br>several of them and examined them carefully. I was convinced,<br>from his intent face and his purposeful manner, that at last he<br>was upon a clue.<br></p>
<p>“Well?” asked Lestrade.<br></p>
<p>Holmes shrugged his shoulders.<br></p>
<p>“We have a long way to go yet,” said he. “And yet—and yet—well,<br>we have some suggestive facts to act upon. The possession of this<br>trifling bust was worth more, in the eyes of this strange<br>criminal, than a human life. That is one point. Then there is the<br>singular fact that he did not break it in the house, or<br>immediately outside the house, if to break it was his sole<br>object.”<br></p>
<p>“He was rattled and bustled by meeting this other fellow. He<br>hardly knew what he was doing.”<br></p>
<p>“Well, that’s likely enough. But I wish to call your attention<br>very particularly to the position of this house, in the garden of<br>which the bust was destroyed.”<br></p>
<p>Lestrade looked about him.<br></p>
<p>“It was an empty house, and so he knew that he would not be<br>disturbed in the garden.”<br></p>
<p>“Yes, but there is another empty house farther up the street<br>which he must have passed before he came to this one. Why did he<br>not break it there, since it is evident that every yard that he<br>carried it increased the risk of someone meeting him?”<br></p>
<p>“I give it up,” said Lestrade.<br></p>
<p>Holmes pointed to the street lamp above our heads.<br></p>
<p>“He could see what he was doing here, and he could not there.<br>That was his reason.”<br></p>
<p>“By Jove! that’s true,” said the detective. “Now that I come to<br>think of it, Dr. Barnicot’s bust was broken not far from his red<br>lamp. Well, Mr. Holmes, what are we to do with that fact?”<br></p>
<p>“To remember it—to docket it. We may come on something later<br>which will bear upon it. What steps do you propose to take now,<br>Lestrade?”<br></p>
<p>“The most practical way of getting at it, in my opinion, is to<br>identify the dead man. There should be no difficulty about that.<br>When we have found who he is and who his associates are, we<br>should have a good start in learning what he was doing in Pitt<br>Street last night, and who it was who met him and killed him on<br>the doorstep of Mr. Horace Harker. Don’t you think so?”<br></p>
<p>“No doubt; and yet it is not quite the way in which I should<br>approach the case.”<br></p>
<p>“What would you do then?”<br></p>
<p>“Oh, you must not let me influence you in any way. I suggest that<br>you go on your line and I on mine. We can compare notes<br>afterwards, and each will supplement the other.”<br></p>
<p>“Very good,” said Lestrade.<br></p>
<p>“If you are going back to Pitt Street, you might see Mr. Horace<br>Harker. Tell him for me that I have quite made up my mind, and<br>that it is certain that a dangerous homicidal lunatic, with<br>Napoleonic delusions, was in his house last night. It will be<br>useful for his article.”<br></p>
<p>Lestrade stared.<br></p>
<p>“You don’t seriously believe that?”<br></p>
<p>Holmes smiled.<br></p>
<p>“Don’t I? Well, perhaps I don’t. But I am sure that it will<br>interest Mr. Horace Harker and the subscribers of the Central<br>Press Syndicate. Now, Watson, I think that we shall find that we<br>have a long and rather complex day’s work before us. I should be<br>glad, Lestrade, if you could make it convenient to meet us at<br>Baker Street at six o’clock this evening. Until then I should<br>like to keep this photograph, found in the dead man’s pocket. It<br>is possible that I may have to ask your company and assistance<br>upon a small expedition which will have be undertaken to-night,<br>if my chain of reasoning should prove to be correct. Until then<br>good-bye and good luck!”<br></p>
<p>Sherlock Holmes and I walked together to the High Street, where<br>we stopped at the shop of Harding Brothers, whence the bust had<br>been purchased. A young assistant informed us that Mr. Harding<br>would be absent until afternoon, and that he was himself a<br>newcomer, who could give us no information. Holmes’s face showed<br>his disappointment and annoyance.<br></p>
<p>“Well, well, we can’t expect to have it all our own way, Watson,”<br>he said, at last. “We must come back in the afternoon, if Mr.<br>Harding will not be here until then. I am, as you have no doubt<br>surmised, endeavouring to trace these busts to their source, in<br>order to find if there is not something peculiar which may<br>account for their remarkable fate. Let us make for Mr. Morse<br>Hudson, of the Kennington Road, and see if he can throw any light<br>upon the problem.”<br></p>
<p>A drive of an hour brought us to the picture-dealer’s<br>establishment. He was a small, stout man with a red face and a<br>peppery manner.<br></p>
<p>“Yes, sir. On my very counter, sir,” said he. “What we pay rates<br>and taxes for I don’t know, when any ruffian can come in and<br>break one’s goods. Yes, sir, it was I who sold Dr. Barnicot his<br>two statues. Disgraceful, sir! A Nihilist plot—that’s what I make<br>it. No one but an anarchist would go about breaking statues. Red<br>republicans—that’s what I call ’em. Who did I get the statues<br>from? I don’t see what that has to do with it. Well, if you<br>really want to know, I got them from Gelder & Co., in Church<br>Street, Stepney. They are a well-known house in the trade, and<br>have been this twenty years. How many had I? Three—two and one<br>are three—two of Dr. Barnicot’s, and one smashed in broad<br>daylight on my own counter. Do I know that photograph? No, I<br>don’t. Yes, I do, though. Why, it’s Beppo. He was a kind of<br>Italian piece-work man, who made himself useful in the shop. He<br>could carve a bit, and gild and frame, and do odd jobs. The<br>fellow left me last week, and I’ve heard nothing of him since.<br>No, I don’t know where he came from nor where he went to. I had<br>nothing against him while he was here. He was gone two days<br>before the bust was smashed.”<br></p>
<p>“Well, that’s all we could reasonably expect from Morse Hudson,”<br>said Holmes, as we emerged from the shop. “We have this Beppo as<br>a common factor, both in Kennington and in Kensington, so that is<br>worth a ten-mile drive. Now, Watson, let us make for Gelder &<br>Co., of Stepney, the source and origin of the busts. I shall be<br>surprised if we don’t get some help down there.”<br></p>
<p>In rapid succession we passed through the fringe of fashionable<br>London, hotel London, theatrical London, literary London,<br>commercial London, and, finally, maritime London, till we came to<br>a riverside city of a hundred thousand souls, where the tenement<br>houses swelter and reek with the outcasts of Europe. Here, in a<br>broad thoroughfare, once the abode of wealthy City merchants, we<br>found the sculpture works for which we searched. Outside was a<br>considerable yard full of monumental masonry. Inside was a large<br>room in which fifty workers were carving or moulding. The<br>manager, a big blond German, received us civilly and gave a clear<br>answer to all Holmes’s questions. A reference to his books showed<br>that hundreds of casts had been taken from a marble copy of<br>Devine’s head of Napoleon, but that the three which had been sent<br>to Morse Hudson a year or so before had been half of a batch of<br>six, the other three being sent to Harding Brothers, of<br>Kensington. There was no reason why those six should be different<br>from any of the other casts. He could suggest no possible cause<br>why anyone should wish to destroy them—in fact, he laughed at the<br>idea. Their wholesale price was six shillings, but the retailer<br>would get twelve or more. The cast was taken in two moulds from<br>each side of the face, and then these two profiles of plaster of<br>Paris were joined together to make the complete bust. The work<br>was usually done by Italians, in the room we were in. When<br>finished, the busts were put on a table in the passage to dry,<br>and afterwards stored. That was all he could tell us.<br></p>
<p>But the production of the photograph had a remarkable effect upon<br>the manager. His face flushed with anger, and his brows knotted<br>over his blue Teutonic eyes.<br></p>
<p>“Ah, the rascal!” he cried. “Yes, indeed, I know him very well.<br>This has always been a respectable establishment, and the only<br>time that we have ever had the police in it was over this very<br>fellow. It was more than a year ago now. He knifed another<br>Italian in the street, and then he came to the works with the<br>police on his heels, and he was taken here. Beppo was his<br>name—his second name I never knew. Serve me right for engaging a<br>man with such a face. But he was a good workman—one of the best.”<br></p>
<p>“What did he get?”<br></p>
<p>“The man lived and he got off with a year. I have no doubt he is<br>out now, but he has not dared to show his nose here. We have a<br>cousin of his here, and I daresay he could tell you where he is.”<br></p>
<p>“No, no,” cried Holmes, “not a word to the cousin—not a word, I<br>beg of you. The matter is very important, and the farther I go<br>with it, the more important it seems to grow. When you referred<br>in your ledger to the sale of those casts I observed that the<br>date was June 3rd of last year. Could you give me the date when<br>Beppo was arrested?”<br></p>
<p>“I could tell you roughly by the pay-list,” the manager answered.<br>“Yes,” he continued, after some turning over of pages, “he was<br>paid last on May 20th.”<br></p>
<p>“Thank you,” said Holmes. “I don’t think that I need intrude upon<br>your time and patience any more.” With a last word of caution<br>that he should say nothing as to our researches, we turned our<br>faces westward once more.<br></p>
<p>The afternoon was far advanced before we were able to snatch a<br>hasty luncheon at a restaurant. A news-bill at the entrance<br>announced “Kensington Outrage. Murder by a Madman,” and the<br>contents of the paper showed that Mr. Horace Harker had got his<br>account into print after all. Two columns were occupied with a<br>highly sensational and flowery rendering of the whole incident.<br>Holmes propped it against the cruet-stand and read it while he<br>ate. Once or twice he chuckled.<br></p>
<p>“This is all right, Watson,” said he. “Listen to this:<br></p>
<p>“It is satisfactory to know that there can be no difference of<br>opinion upon this case, since Mr. Lestrade, one of the most<br>experienced members of the official force, and Mr. Sherlock<br>Holmes, the well-known consulting expert, have each come to the<br>conclusion that the grotesque series of incidents, which have<br>ended in so tragic a fashion, arise from lunacy rather than from<br>deliberate crime. No explanation save mental aberration can cover<br>the facts.<br></p>
<p>“The Press, Watson, is a most valuable institution, if you only<br>know how to use it. And now, if you have quite finished, we will<br>hark back to Kensington and see what the manager of Harding<br>Brothers has to say on the matter.”<br></p>
<p>The founder of that great emporium proved to be a brisk, crisp<br>little person, very dapper and quick, with a clear head and a<br>ready tongue.<br></p>
<p>“Yes, sir, I have already read the account in the evening papers.<br>Mr. Horace Harker is a customer of ours. We supplied him with the<br>bust some months ago. We ordered three busts of that sort from<br>Gelder & Co., of Stepney. They are all sold now. To whom? Oh, I<br>daresay by consulting our sales book we could very easily tell<br>you. Yes, we have the entries here. One to Mr. Harker you see,<br>and one to Mr. Josiah Brown, of Laburnum Lodge, Laburnum Vale,<br>Chiswick, and one to Mr. Sandeford, of Lower Grove Road, Reading.<br>No, I have never seen this face which you show me in the<br>photograph. You would hardly forget it, would you, sir, for I’ve<br>seldom seen an uglier. Have we any Italians on the staff? Yes,<br>sir, we have several among our workpeople and cleaners. I daresay<br>they might get a peep at that sales book if they wanted to. There<br>is no particular reason for keeping a watch upon that book. Well,<br>well, it’s a very strange business, and I hope that you will let<br>me know if anything comes of your inquiries.”<br></p>
<p>Holmes had taken several notes during Mr. Harding’s evidence, and<br>I could see that he was thoroughly satisfied by the turn which<br>affairs were taking. He made no remark, however, save that,<br>unless we hurried, we should be late for our appointment with<br>Lestrade. Sure enough, when we reached Baker Street the detective<br>was already there, and we found him pacing up and down in a fever<br>of impatience. His look of importance showed that his day’s work<br>had not been in vain.<br></p>
<p>“Well?” he asked. “What luck, Mr. Holmes?”<br></p>
<p>“We have had a very busy day, and not entirely a wasted one,” my<br>friend explained. “We have seen both the retailers and also the<br>wholesale manufacturers. I can trace each of the busts now from<br>the beginning.”<br></p>
<p>“The busts,” cried Lestrade. “Well, well, you have your own<br>methods, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, and it is not for me to say a word<br>against them, but I think I have done a better day’s work than<br>you. I have identified the dead man.”<br></p>
<p>“You don’t say so?”<br></p>
<p>“And found a cause for the crime.”<br></p>
<p>“Splendid!”<br></p>
<p>“We have an inspector who makes a specialty of Saffron Hill and<br>the Italian Quarter. Well, this dead man had some Catholic emblem<br>round his neck, and that, along with his colour, made me think he<br>was from the South. Inspector Hill knew him the moment he caught<br>sight of him. His name is Pietro Venucci, from Naples, and he is<br>one of the greatest cut-throats in London. He is connected with<br>the Mafia, which, as you know, is a secret political society,<br>enforcing its decrees by murder. Now, you see how the affair<br>begins to clear up. The other fellow is probably an Italian also,<br>and a member of the Mafia. He has broken the rules in some<br>fashion. Pietro is set upon his track. Probably the photograph we<br>found in his pocket is the man himself, so that he may not knife<br>the wrong person. He dogs the fellow, he sees him enter a house,<br>he waits outside for him, and in the scuffle he receives his own<br>death-wound. How is that, Mr. Sherlock Holmes?”<br></p>
<p>Holmes clapped his hands approvingly.<br></p>
<p>“Excellent, Lestrade, excellent!” he cried. “But I didn’t quite<br>follow your explanation of the destruction of the busts.”<br></p>
<p>“The busts! You never can get those busts out of your head. After<br>all, that is nothing; petty larceny, six months at the most. It<br>is the murder that we are really investigating, and I tell you<br>that I am gathering all the threads into my hands.”<br></p>
<p>“And the next stage?”<br></p>
<p>“Is a very simple one. I shall go down with Hill to the Italian<br>Quarter, find the man whose photograph we have got, and arrest<br>him on the charge of murder. Will you come with us?”<br></p>
<p>“I think not. I fancy we can attain our end in a simpler way. I<br>can’t say for certain, because it all depends—well, it all<br>depends upon a factor which is completely outside our control.<br>But I have great hopes—in fact, the betting is exactly two to<br>one—that if you will come with us to-night I shall be able to<br>help you to lay him by the heels.”<br></p>
<p>“In the Italian Quarter?”<br></p>
<p>“No, I fancy Chiswick is an address which is more likely to find<br>him. If you will come with me to Chiswick to-night, Lestrade,<br>I’ll promise to go to the Italian Quarter with you to-morrow, and<br>no harm will be done by the delay. And now I think that a few<br>hours’ sleep would do us all good, for I do not propose to leave<br>before eleven o’clock, and it is unlikely that we shall be back<br>before morning. You’ll dine with us, Lestrade, and then you are<br>welcome to the sofa until it is time for us to start. In the<br>meantime, Watson, I should be glad if you would ring for an<br>express messenger, for I have a letter to send and it is<br>important that it should go at once.”<br></p>
<p>Holmes spent the evening in rummaging among the files of the old<br>daily papers with which one of our lumber-rooms was packed. When<br>at last he descended, it was with triumph in his eyes, but he<br>said nothing to either of us as to the result of his researches.<br>For my own part, I had followed step by step the methods by which<br>he had traced the various windings of this complex case, and,<br>though I could not yet perceive the goal which we would reach, I<br>understood clearly that Holmes expected this grotesque criminal<br>to make an attempt upon the two remaining busts, one of which, I<br>remembered, was at Chiswick. No doubt the object of our journey<br>was to catch him in the very act, and I could not but admire the<br>cunning with which my friend had inserted a wrong clue in the<br>evening paper, so as to give the fellow the idea that he could<br>continue his scheme with impunity. I was not surprised when<br>Holmes suggested that I should take my revolver with me. He had<br>himself picked up the loaded hunting-crop, which was his<br>favourite weapon.<br></p>
<p>A four-wheeler was at the door at eleven, and in it we drove to a<br>spot at the other side of Hammersmith Bridge. Here the cabman was<br>directed to wait. A short walk brought us to a secluded road<br>fringed with pleasant houses, each standing in its own grounds.<br>In the light of a street lamp we read “Laburnum Villa” upon the<br>gate-post of one of them. The occupants had evidently retired to<br>rest, for all was dark save for a fanlight over the hall door,<br>which shed a single blurred circle on to the garden path. The<br>wooden fence which separated the grounds from the road threw a<br>dense black shadow upon the inner side, and here it was that we<br>crouched.<br></p>
<p>“I fear that you’ll have a long wait,” Holmes whispered. “We may<br>thank our stars that it is not raining. I don’t think we can even<br>venture to smoke to pass the time. However, it’s a two to one<br>chance that we get something to pay us for our trouble.”<br></p>
<p>It proved, however, that our vigil was not to be so long as<br>Holmes had led us to fear, and it ended in a very sudden and<br>singular fashion. In an instant, without the least sound to warn<br>us of his coming, the garden gate swung open, and a lithe, dark<br>figure, as swift and active as an ape, rushed up the garden path.<br>We saw it whisk past the light thrown from over the door and<br>disappear against the black shadow of the house. There was a long<br>pause, during which we held our breath, and then a very gentle<br>creaking sound came to our ears. The window was being opened. The<br>noise ceased, and again there was a long silence. The fellow was<br>making his way into the house. We saw the sudden flash of a dark<br>lantern inside the room. What he sought was evidently not there,<br>for again we saw the flash through another blind, and then<br>through another.<br></p>
<p>“Let us get to the open window. We will nab him as he climbs<br>out,” Lestrade whispered.<br></p>
<p>But before we could move, the man had emerged again. As he came<br>out into the glimmering patch of light, we saw that he carried<br>something white under his arm. He looked stealthily all round<br>him. The silence of the deserted street reassured him. Turning<br>his back upon us he laid down his burden, and the next instant<br>there was the sound of a sharp tap, followed by a clatter and<br>rattle. The man was so intent upon what he was doing that he<br>never heard our steps as we stole across the grass plot. With the<br>bound of a tiger Holmes was on his back, and an instant later<br>Lestrade and I had him by either wrist, and the handcuffs had<br>been fastened. As we turned him over I saw a hideous, sallow<br>face, with writhing, furious features, glaring up at us, and I<br>knew that it was indeed the man of the photograph whom we had<br>secured.<br></p>
<p>But it was not our prisoner to whom Holmes was giving his<br>attention. Squatted on the doorstep, he was engaged in most<br>carefully examining that which the man had brought from the<br>house. It was a bust of Napoleon, like the one which we had seen<br>that morning, and it had been broken into similar fragments.<br>Carefully Holmes held each separate shard to the light, but in no<br>way did it differ from any other shattered piece of plaster. He<br>had just completed his examination when the hall lights flew up,<br>the door opened, and the owner of the house, a jovial, rotund<br>figure in shirt and trousers, presented himself.<br></p>
<p>“Mr. Josiah Brown, I suppose?” said Holmes.<br></p>
<p>“Yes, sir; and you, no doubt, are Mr. Sherlock Holmes? I had the<br>note which you sent by the express messenger, and I did exactly<br>what you told me. We locked every door on the inside and awaited<br>developments. Well, I’m very glad to see that you have got the<br>rascal. I hope, gentlemen, that you will come in and have some<br>refreshment.”<br></p>
<p>However, Lestrade was anxious to get his man into safe quarters,<br>so within a few minutes our cab had been summoned and we were all<br>four upon our way to London. Not a word would our captive say,<br>but he glared at us from the shadow of his matted hair, and once,<br>when my hand seemed within his reach, he snapped at it like a<br>hungry wolf. We stayed long enough at the police-station to learn<br>that a search of his clothing revealed nothing save a few<br>shillings and a long sheath knife, the handle of which bore<br>copious traces of recent blood.<br></p>
<p>“That’s all right,” said Lestrade, as we parted. “Hill knows all<br>these gentry, and he will give a name to him. You’ll find that my<br>theory of the Mafia will work out all right. But I’m sure I am<br>exceedingly obliged to you, Mr. Holmes, for the workmanlike way<br>in which you laid hands upon him. I don’t quite understand it all<br>yet.”<br></p>
<p>“I fear it is rather too late an hour for explanations,” said<br>Holmes. “Besides, there are one or two details which are not<br>finished off, and it is one of those cases which are worth<br>working out to the very end. If you will come round once more to<br>my rooms at six o’clock to-morrow, I think I shall be able to<br>show you that even now you have not grasped the entire meaning of<br>this business, which presents some features which make it<br>absolutely original in the history of crime. If ever I permit you<br>to chronicle any more of my little problems, Watson, I foresee<br>that you will enliven your pages by an account of the singular<br>adventure of the Napoleonic busts.”<br></p>
<p>When we met again next evening, Lestrade was furnished with much<br>information concerning our prisoner. His name, it appeared, was<br>Beppo, second name unknown. He was a well-known ne’er-do-well<br>among the Italian colony. He had once been a skilful sculptor and<br>had earned an honest living, but he had taken to evil courses and<br>had twice already been in jail—once for a petty theft, and once,<br>as we had already heard, for stabbing a fellow-countryman. He<br>could talk English perfectly well. His reasons for destroying the<br>busts were still unknown, and he refused to answer any questions<br>upon the subject, but the police had discovered that these same<br>busts might very well have been made by his own hands, since he<br>was engaged in this class of work at the establishment of Gelder<br>& Co. To all this information, much of which we already knew,<br>Holmes listened with polite attention, but I, who knew him so<br>well, could clearly see that his thoughts were elsewhere, and I<br>detected a mixture of mingled uneasiness and expectation beneath<br>that mask which he was wont to assume. At last he started in his<br>chair, and his eyes brightened. There had been a ring at the<br>bell. A minute later we heard steps upon the stairs, and an<br>elderly red-faced man with grizzled side-whiskers was ushered in.<br>In his right hand he carried an old-fashioned carpet-bag, which<br>he placed upon the table.<br></p>
<p>“Is Mr. Sherlock Holmes here?”<br></p>
<p>My friend bowed and smiled. “Mr. Sandeford, of Reading, I<br>suppose?” said he.<br></p>
<p>“Yes, sir, I fear that I am a little late, but the trains were<br>awkward. You wrote to me about a bust that is in my possession.”<br></p>
<p>“Exactly.”<br></p>
<p>“I have your letter here. You said, ‘I desire to possess a copy<br>of Devine’s Napoleon, and am prepared to pay you ten pounds for<br>the one which is in your possession.’ Is that right?”<br></p>
<p>“Certainly.”<br></p>
<p>“I was very much surprised at your letter, for I could not<br>imagine how you knew that I owned such a thing.”<br></p>
<p>“Of course you must have been surprised, but the explanation is<br>very simple. Mr. Harding, of Harding Brothers, said that they had<br>sold you their last copy, and he gave me your address.”<br></p>
<p>“Oh, that was it, was it? Did he tell you what I paid for it?”<br></p>
<p>“No, he did not.”<br></p>
<p>“Well, I am an honest man, though not a very rich one. I only<br>gave fifteen shillings for the bust, and I think you ought to<br>know that before I take ten pounds from you.<br></p>
<p>“I am sure the scruple does you honour, Mr. Sandeford. But I have<br>named that price, so I intend to stick to it.”<br></p>
<p>“Well, it is very handsome of you, Mr. Holmes. I brought the bust<br>up with me, as you asked me to do. Here it is!” He opened his<br>bag, and at last we saw placed upon our table a complete specimen<br>of that bust which we had already seen more than once in<br>fragments.<br></p>
<p>Holmes took a paper from his pocket and laid a ten-pound note<br>upon the table.<br></p>
<p>“You will kindly sign that paper, Mr. Sandeford, in the presence<br>of these witnesses. It is simply to say that you transfer every<br>possible right that you ever had in the bust to me. I am a<br>methodical man, you see, and you never know what turn events<br>might take afterwards. Thank you, Mr. Sandeford; here is your<br>money, and I wish you a very good evening.”<br></p>
<p>When our visitor had disappeared, Sherlock Holmes’s movements<br>were such as to rivet our attention. He began by taking a clean<br>white cloth from a drawer and laying it over the table. Then he<br>placed his newly acquired bust in the centre of the cloth.<br>Finally, he picked up his hunting-crop and struck Napoleon a<br>sharp blow on the top of the head. The figure broke into<br>fragments, and Holmes bent eagerly over the shattered remains.<br>Next instant, with a loud shout of triumph he held up one<br>splinter, in which a round, dark object was fixed like a plum in<br>a pudding.<br></p>
<p>“Gentlemen,” he cried, “let me introduce you to the famous black<br>pearl of the Borgias.”<br></p>
<p>Lestrade and I sat silent for a moment, and then, with a<br>spontaneous impulse, we both broke at clapping, as at the<br>well-wrought crisis of a play. A flush of colour sprang to<br>Holmes’s pale cheeks, and he bowed to us like the master<br>dramatist who receives the homage of his audience. It was at such<br>moments that for an instant he ceased to be a reasoning machine,<br>and betrayed his human love for admiration and applause. The same<br>singularly proud and reserved nature which turned away with<br>disdain from popular notoriety was capable of being moved to its<br>depths by spontaneous wonder and praise from a friend.<br></p>
<p>“Yes, gentlemen,” said he, “it is the most famous pearl now<br>existing in the world, and it has been my good fortune, by a<br>connected chain of inductive reasoning, to trace it from the<br>Prince of Colonna’s bedroom at the Dacre Hotel, where it was<br>lost, to the interior of this, the last of the six busts of<br>Napoleon which were manufactured by Gelder & Co., of Stepney. You<br>will remember, Lestrade, the sensation caused by the<br>disappearance of this valuable jewel and the vain efforts of the<br>London police to recover it. I was myself consulted upon the<br>case, but I was unable to throw any light upon it. Suspicion fell<br>upon the maid of the Princess, who was an Italian, and it was<br>proved that she had a brother in London, but we failed to trace<br>any connection between them. The maid’s name was Lucretia<br>Venucci, and there is no doubt in my mind that this Pietro who<br>was murdered two nights ago was the brother. I have been looking<br>up the dates in the old files of the paper, and I find that the<br>disappearance of the pearl was exactly two days before the arrest<br>of Beppo, for some crime of violence—an event which took place in<br>the factory of Gelder & Co., at the very moment when these busts<br>were being made. Now you clearly see the sequence of events,<br>though you see them, of course, in the inverse order to the way<br>in which they presented themselves to me. Beppo had the pearl in<br>his possession. He may have stolen it from Pietro, he may have<br>been Pietro’s confederate, he may have been the go-between of<br>Pietro and his sister. It is of no consequence to us which is the<br>correct solution.<br></p>
<p>“The main fact is that he _had_ the pearl, and at that moment,<br>when it was on his person, he was pursued by the police. He made<br>for the factory in which he worked, and he knew that he had only<br>a few minutes in which to conceal this enormously valuable prize,<br>which would otherwise be found on him when he was searched. Six<br>plaster casts of Napoleon were drying in the passage. One of them<br>was still soft. In an instant Beppo, a skilful workman, made a<br>small hole in the wet plaster, dropped in the pearl, and with a<br>few touches covered over the aperture once more. It was an<br>admirable hiding-place. No one could possibly find it. But Beppo<br>was condemned to a year’s imprisonment, and in the meanwhile his<br>six busts were scattered over London. He could not tell which<br>contained his treasure. Only by breaking them could he see. Even<br>shaking would tell him nothing, for as the plaster was wet it was<br>probable that the pearl would adhere to it—as, in fact, it has<br>done. Beppo did not despair, and he conducted his search with<br>considerable ingenuity and perseverance. Through a cousin who<br>works with Gelder, he found out the retail firms who had bought<br>the busts. He managed to find employment with Morse Hudson, and<br>in that way tracked down three of them. The pearl was not there.<br>Then, with the help of some Italian employee, he succeeded in<br>finding out where the other three busts had gone. The first was<br>at Harker’s. There he was dogged by his confederate, who held<br>Beppo responsible for the loss of the pearl, and he stabbed him<br>in the scuffle which followed.”<br></p>
<p>“If he was his confederate, why should he carry his photograph?”<br>I asked.<br></p>
<p>“As a means of tracing him, if he wished to inquire about him<br>from any third person. That was the obvious reason. Well, after<br>the murder I calculated that Beppo would probably hurry rather<br>than delay his movements. He would fear that the police would<br>read his secret, and so he hastened on before they should get<br>ahead of him. Of course, I could not say that he had not found<br>the pearl in Harker’s bust. I had not even concluded for certain<br>that it was the pearl, but it was evident to me that he was<br>looking for something, since he carried the bust past the other<br>houses in order to break it in the garden which had a lamp<br>overlooking it. Since Harker’s bust was one in three, the chances<br>were exactly as I told you—two to one against the pearl being<br>inside it. There remained two busts, and it was obvious that he<br>would go for the London one first. I warned the inmates of the<br>house, so as to avoid a second tragedy, and we went down, with<br>the happiest results. By that time, of course, I knew for certain<br>that it was the Borgia pearl that we were after. The name of the<br>murdered man linked the one event with the other. There only<br>remained a single bust—the Reading one—and the pearl must be<br>there. I bought it in your presence from the owner—and there it<br>lies.”<br></p>
<p>We sat in silence for a moment.<br></p>
<p>“Well,” said Lestrade, “I’ve seen you handle a good many cases,<br>Mr. Holmes, but I don’t know that I ever knew a more workmanlike<br>one than that. We’re not jealous of you at Scotland Yard. No,<br>sir, we are very proud of you, and if you come down to-morrow,<br>there’s not a man, from the oldest inspector to the youngest<br>constable, who wouldn’t be glad to shake you by the hand.”<br></p>
<p>“Thank you!” said Holmes. “Thank you!” and as he turned away, it<br>seemed to me that he was more nearly moved by the softer human<br>emotions than I had ever seen him. A moment later he was the cold<br>and practical thinker once more. “Put the pearl in the safe,<br>Watson,” said he, “and get out the papers of the Conk-Singleton<br>forgery case. Good-bye, Lestrade. If any little problem comes<br>your way, I shall be happy, if I can, to give you a hint or two<br>as to its solution.”<br></p>
